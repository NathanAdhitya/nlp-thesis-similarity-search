      "Abstract: This study explores the application of natural language processing techniques for automated essay scoring. Traditional methods of essay assessment are time-consuming and subject to human bias. We propose a machine learning approach that analyzes linguistic features, semantic coherence, and grammatical structure to provide consistent and objective scoring. Our model incorporates word embeddings, syntactic parsing, and discourse analysis to evaluate essays across multiple dimensions. Experimental results on a dataset of 10,000 student essays show that our approach achieves a correlation of 0.85 with human graders, outperforming existing automated systems. This research has significant implications for educational assessment, potentially reducing grading workload while maintaining evaluation quality.\n",
