  "title": "The Statistical relationship between email marketing performance and customer acquisition: a quantitative and qualitative study on IBFD",
  "abstract": "Studies have shown that email marketing is one of the most cost-effective marketing tools. Email marketing is one of the tools to improve customer acquisition and lead generation in the sales funnel model. IDFD relies heavily on email marketing to promote its entire product portfolio. This research was initiated to find the relationship between email marketing and customer acquisition. Using multiple regression analysis, it has been discovered that there is a positive causal relationship between email marketing and customer acquisition. More effective email marketing, denoted by email marketing metrics, leads to a higher customer acquisition, denoted by lead generation. This research has found that newsletter signups and delivery rate are the two most significant email marketing metrics (independent variables) that can explain the changes in lead generation (as the dependent variable). In other words, an increase in newsletter signups or delivery rate will result in a significant increase in lead generation. Therefore, this research also looked for ways to improve both newsletter signups and delivery rate which will in turn improve customer acquisition.",
