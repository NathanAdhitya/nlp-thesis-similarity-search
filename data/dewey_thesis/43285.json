  "title": "Increasing the brand awareness of Sans Power's consumers by highlighting its unique selling points in its marketing booklet",
  "abstract": "Established in 2010, Sans Power is a trading company selling solar-energy products, like solar water pumps and solar panels. It is run by PT. Java Surya Teknik and is owned by Mr Larungki Adeka Pradipta. It offers a variety of solar water pumps based on the function, which are Submersible Solar Pump, Surface Solar Pump, and Solar Pool Pump. The main problem Sans Power is currently facing is the salespeople find it hard to explain to its customers and prospects about the unique benefits of buying Sans Power’s products because this company only has a general company profile and a catalogue emphasizing only the technical specification of the products. Therefore, a marketing booklet emphasizing the uniqueness of the products would be a solution. The unique selling points are the high efficient products, the installation services, and the extra services the customers can get. The marketing booklet will become the tool for the sales and marketing team to offer the unique benefits the customers can get. It will also make customers know more about Sans Power’s products and services, which can attract them to increase sales.",
