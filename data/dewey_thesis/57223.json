  "abstract": "This study was conducted to analyze code-mixing types used by Iman Usman as a young adulthood resource person and Faisal Basri as a middle adulthood resource person in Gita Wirjawan’s Endgame, as the similarities and differences of Iman Usman and Faisal Basri’s code-mixing types. In this study, the writer used the theory of code-mixing types proposed by Muysken (2000). The writer used a qualitative approach in this study. The findings of this study showed that Both Iman Usman and Faisal Basri used all the code-mixing types: insertion, alternation and congruent lexicalization. Content word was widely found in this study, both Iman Usman and Faisal Basri repeatedly applied the code-mixing with possessed content word which were nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. Moreover, age factor did really affect Iman Usman and Faisal Basri when using code-mixing in their conversation with Gita Wirjawan. Iman Usman quite often used code mixing compared to Faisal Basri, who is relatively rare. It is suggested that future studies involve different other platforms and generations, in order to enrich the field.",
