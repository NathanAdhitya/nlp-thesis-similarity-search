  "title": "The Study of code switching in RCTI program Keluarga Van Danoe in the episode \"seputar Van Danoe\"",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of code switching in one of the \"sine- tron\"(cinema electronics)program in RCTI.RCTI is one of the Indonesian private television channels.The program that is chosen for this study is a popular situational comedy Keluarga Van Danoe (Van Danoe Family)in its episode \"Seputar Van Danoe\". The program of Keluarga Van Danoe has provided many switchings. Therefore,this study is trying to make a description of the kinds of code switchings i.e.metaphorical code switching,situational code switching and conversationa1 code switching,which might occur in one of the episodes by analysing its features of context and characterisation.Then,the writer would like to explain the reasons or factors which might underlie the existence of code switchings in the episode of \"Seputar Van Danoe\".The analysis of this study is based on the conversation of the characters that appears in the episode of \"Seputar Van Danoe\".To be able to answer the problems several theories of Sociolinguistics are employed,such as the theory of the varieties of code switchings, and some other theories that related to the reasons that might underlie the occurence of code switchings,such as.Holmes'theory of solidarity,Savi1le-Troike's theory of real lexical needs and so on .Also since the data is in the form of conversation,the writer uses Discourse Analysis theory namely Dell Hymes'Ethnog -raphy of Speaking Theory in order to provide the context of the utterance.From the findings and the conclusion,it is found out that not all of the three kinds of code switchings i.e .metaphori -cal ,situational and conversational suggested by Gumperz exist in the chosen episode.Code switching that occurs in this episode is only one kind namely the conversational one.The providing topics and setting which are not so various might be the limitation of this study.Finally,the writer also finds out that at least, there are nine reasons or factors that might underlie the switch- inq from one code to another code in the episode of \"Seputar Van Danoe\".A great deal of code switchings in this episode is mainly caused by the real lexical needs in the conversation.",
