  "abstract": "This study deals with the African-American vernacular English (AAVE) features produced by the characters, both black and white American in ?White Chicks? movie. The writer chose this topic because she realized that many English varieties exist and those varieties are somewhat different from Standard English. AAVE is one of the prominent varieties that exists in the U.S. and has some unique features. In conducting this study, the writer focused on answering two research questions concerning black main characters who used AAVE features and the white main characters who used AAVE features as well as the type of AAVE features used in this movie. Besides, in order to identify the AAVE features used by the main characters, both black and white, she used Trudgill?s AAVE theory (1974), and Labov?s AAVE theory (1972). The finding shows that the main characters, both black and white main characters, used 9 AAVE features and the dominant AAVE features used by characters in this movie is the use of the non-standard future tense form which consists of the use of the word \"gonna\". Therefore, the writer hopes that this research can inspire the next readers who want to discuss about AAVE features.",
