This study aimed to reveal the types of functions of language and also the frequency of the functions of language that mostly occur in the Ambonesse song lyrics. Totally, there were 10 song lyrics that were used in this study in which the writer used the theory of functions of language as the main theory. After analyzing the data, the writer found out that the types of functions of language that can be identified in the song lyrics were informative function, setting or contextual function, emotive function, directive function, and poetic function. From the analysis, it can be seen clearly that the functions of language that were found in the song lyrics played their own role, especially to revive the spirit of being united among the Moluccans after the tragedy that happened in 1999 which destroyed the brotherhood bond in Moluccas. Also, the writer found out that informative function had the biggest number of occurrence.",
