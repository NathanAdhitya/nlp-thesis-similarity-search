  "abstract": "This study observes the perceived meanings produced by two different social classes, which are White and Blue Collar respondents as respondents from different social class can produce different perceived meanings from each other. After finding out what the perceived meanings are from the respondents, writer proceeds on to the analyzing process in order to find the differences between White and Blue Collar respondents’ perceived meanings. By implementing Stuart Hall’s Encoding and Decoding, Pierce’s Process of Signification and Triadic Sign Model, writer analyzed how meanings in McDonalds’s Happy Meal® video commercial are perceived. The study uses descriptive qualitative approach to explain the meaning of qualitative material in a more systematic way. The writer of this study discovered several conclusions. The writer concludes that white collar respondents tend to prioritize pride, prestige and esteem. Meanwhile, blue collar respondents tend to prioritize their primary needs and responsibilities before spending on secondary needs. Through this study, the writer expects that the result will help readers understand the influence of incomes between social classes in perceiving meanings from an advertisement.",
