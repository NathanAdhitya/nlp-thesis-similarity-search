(4) What are the reasons affecting the use of the address terms: the servants' own wish, the masters' command, or the imitation of other servants?

Regarding the servants; age of the servants gives bigger influence than the education to the way they address their masters.

The writer also finds that the most reason affecting the use of the address term is the servants' own wish.",
