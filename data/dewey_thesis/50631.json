  "abstract": "With the continuous growth in data quantities in businesses, having essential and complete information by hand is becoming increasingly difficult. Thus, business intelligence (BI) tools can be helpful in this situation because it provides tools and technology to aid in collecting, integrating, storing, modifying, and analyzing existing data. However, Mobile internet access affects how individuals consume information. As a result, it also affects the way BI performs its output (e.g., Dashboard and Report) can be accessed via Mobile and Tablet. Of course, using mobile and tablet is very efficient to help top-level management make decisions faster because decision-making can be done anytime and anywhere instead of using a laptop or PC, which is more difficult to access. Therefore, this paper will explain one of Indonesia's largest automobile companies to make BI information available on Tablet only. The details are more about sharing the author's experience regarding BI in general in the company concerned, the processes, and difficulties of the author while making information available in Tablet.",
