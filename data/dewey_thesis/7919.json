  "abstract": "The Pilgrim is a novel written by an Indonesian experimental playwright and novelist, Iwan Simatupang. Using the European existentialist techniques, Simatupang in this novel expresses the pain he felt after his wife?s death. The novel tells about a story of a painter who loses his wife, becomes miserable, struggles to overcome his problem and finally comes to the terms with reality. In this study, I am interested in analyzing the development of the main character from a depressed person to a realistic person. In the analysis, I use literary approach consisting of the theories characterization and conflict. In addition, I use the concept of depression to facilitate the analysis. From the analysis, I find out that the death of his wife has brought great depressions toward him. In solving his problem, the main character faces several conflicts, both external conflict and internal conflict, which eventually help him to develop from a depressed person to a realistic person. Finally, he is able to accept the reality and decides to live near his wife?s grave by taking over the job of cemetery overseer. This novel gives a picture about how human being deal with their problem and how they overcome it.",
