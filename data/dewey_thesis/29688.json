  "title": "A Study of Sarah's and Muriel's relationship with Macon through communication as seen in Anne Tyler's novel The Accidental Tourist",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of two main female characters’, Sarah and Muriel, relationship with the main male character, Macon Leary, through their way of communication as seen in Anne Tyler’s The Accidental Tourist. Wondering about the different result of the relationship between Sarah and Muriel, with the main male character, Macon Leary, I analyze some factors that influence their relationship through their way of communication. By applying some literary devices, which are characterization and conflict, I found out that the ineffective relationship between Sarah and Macon is caused by Sarah’s domination and lack of understanding. This condition makes her lack understanding toward Macon’s communication apprehension and self-confidence. On the contrary, the relationship between Muriel and Macon can work effectively. It is caused by the respect, friendly attitude and understanding that Muriel builds in her relationship with Macon. This condition also helps Macon to overcome his communication apprehension and increase his self-confidence in developing a better relationship.",
