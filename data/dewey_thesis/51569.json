  "title": "Still: a screenplay exploring death anxiety—the fear of losing a loved one",
  "abstract": "The fear of death has long plagued people for its unknown implications and the burden of grief that comes with it; however, it is not something that people often acknowledge. This work intends to highlight that fear-related issues, specifically the fear of losing a loved one, should not be understated as trivial negative emotions. People should raise more awareness on it as it affects their mental well-being and connection with others. Using the death anxiety and protection motivation theories, I discovered that there are hidden conflicts behind death anxiety that people need to address to minimize their psychological symptoms and eventually undergo a successful coping process. The story is woven around the structure of alternate universes, dark fantasy themes, and follows the struggle of Sasha. Sasha initially rejects her beloved Kaiser’s death by creating alternate universes through a supernatural source to save him, but then slowly realizes that her interferences are harmful. In the end, she finally lets Kaiser die to fulfill his heroic fate and moves on. Through that angle, this work aims to motivate people that while death happens inevitably, they can always handle their fear of losing their loved ones through a more positive mindset.",
