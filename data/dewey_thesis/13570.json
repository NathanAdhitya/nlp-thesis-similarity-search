  "title": "A Study of coruption through the characters in John Gay's The Beggaar's Opera",
  "abstract": "The Beggar's Opera by John Gay is a literary work that deals with the social problems of English society in the eighteen century. One of the problems is about the corruption that happens in every class of the society. This thesis is about the nature of human being, that is corruption, which can be seen through the characters in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. The thesis writer will analyze the corrupt characters, Peachum, Lockit, Women of the town and Macheath, that represent different social classes by using the literary approach with theory of characterization and the theory of setting as the tools. From the analysis of the characters in the play, the thesis writer finds out that everyone has a tendency to be selfish and greedy, that is why they are corrupt to make themselves happy. Then, she finally concludes that these characters are corrupt since it is in their nature and because of the setting.",
