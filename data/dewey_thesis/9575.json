  "abstract": "This thesis discusses Anna Christie searches for happiness in Eugene O?Neill?s Anna Christie. Anna Christie has a terrible childhood, since she was left by her father. Therefore she lacks of affection and feels lonely. She wants to search for happiness. I want to know the causes and her ways to search for happiness. To analyze why and how Anna Christie searches for happiness, I use literary approach, namely conflict and characterization. I also use the concept of happiness to support my analysis. Through the analysis, I find out that there are two causes that make Anna Christie searches for happiness. First, she lacks affection and the second she is lonely. She lacks affection because she never felt the love from her parents and her relatives. She is also lonely. She has nobody to share her problems with, so she wants to find happiness. In order to find happiness, Anna Christie has to look for her father and accept the reality of her father?s condition. As a result, she finds that the sea can give her the happiness which she never got.",
