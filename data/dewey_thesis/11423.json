  "abstract": "This is a study about ARO (Autonomous Robotic Organisms) namely Optimus Prime?s being more human than Megatron, in Alan Dean Foster?s Transformers. In this thesis, I will reveal the causes and the ways why Optimus Prime is more human than Megatron. I will use the literary approach by means of characterization and conflict. Both the theory of conflict and characterization will be used to analyze Optimus Prime in order to reveal the causes and the ways of Optimus Prime to be more human than Megatron. In analyzing this novel, I will analyze the causes Optimus Prime?s being more human than Megatron. They are his love of peace, Earthmen, and Earth, his forgiving heart, his polite speech, and his objections to Megatron?s greediness and hurting. Meanwhile, in discussions of the ways, I discover the actions that Optimus Prime does. The actions that Optimus Prime takes are treating human nicely, making ally, restricting Megatron?s and Decepticons? plans, getting the Earthmen involved in reaching the Cube and sacrificing himself for the sake of everyone. Optimus Prime is more human than Megatron since he has good characteristics, unlike Megatron. There is no doubt that he can show his good characteristics through his actions. Therefore, from the characteristics he has and actions he does, Optimus Prime is more human than Megatron.",
