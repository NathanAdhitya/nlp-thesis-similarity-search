  "title": "Types of directives and women speech features used by the superior and subordinates in the restaurant",
  "abstract": "Giving directives in a restaurant is a common situation. The directives usually occur in the conversation between the superior and the subordinates. However, they sometimes do not realize when they make directives to each other. Moreover, since the writer is interested in women language, the writer only chose the female supervisor and waitresses in the restaurant as her subjects so that she could analyze the speech features in the restaurant especially in giving directives. The writer used Lakoff?s theory of women language to analyze the speech features and the theory of types of directives by Ervin-Tripp (1976) to analyze the types of directives. In addition, the writer also used Holmes? theory about social factors and dimension. The writer classified utterances that contained directives and speech features in one sentence. The result showed that both superior and subordinates used almost all types of directives and speech features. The differences were the superior did not use permission directive and the subordinates did not use need statement as their types of directives. Even though Lakoff proposed ten types of women?s language, only five speech features occurred in their utterances. Finally, the writer found that the social factors and social dimension (the status and solidarity) between them affected the way the talked.",
