  "abstract": "This study examines the translation strategies of the terminologies in the thesis eighty abstracts of the Faculty of Industrial Technology. There are twenty abstracts from the Industrial Engineering Department, twenty-one abstracts from the Mechanical Engineering and Design, twenty abstracts from the Business Information System, and nineteen abstracts from the Electrical Engineering Department. The writer uses Bakerâ€™s (2018) eight translation strategies as the main theory. This study applies a descriptive qualitative methodology for the research. The result of the study found that translators used five of eight translation strategies in translating terminologies in the thesis abstracts. The strategies are general word, cultural substitution, loan word/ loan word with explanation, paraphrase using related word, paraphrase using unrelated word. This study shows that loan words are the strategy that is used the most in translating terminologies. This strategy mostly used because a lot of terminology from abstracts of the faculty of Industrial Technology are comes from English word.",
