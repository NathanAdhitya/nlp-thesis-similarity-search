  "abstract": "To continue being one of the leaders in the food and beverage industry, Kraft Heinz Company commits to have the best human capital. The company's human resource and learning and development department has several projects to address this, including Ownerversity. This research focuses on the supplier selection part of the strategic procurement process of procuring materials for that corporate university after the process of e-auction. With the growing demand for transparency in supplier selection, the selection criteria must be clear so that the suppliers can also highlight their values aside from price. The author analyzes past e-auctions and contract awarding conducted under KHC's HR projects to see what the important decision making factors and their order of importance by using binary logistic regression. The order of the importance are then used to calculate the respective weights of the factor by using AHP, which results in a scorecard that can be used to evaluate suppliers after conducting the e-auction.",
