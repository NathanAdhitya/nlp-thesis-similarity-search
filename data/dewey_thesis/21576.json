In James agee's A Death in the Familv, Hary Follet and Rufus Follet have to face the sudden death of Jay Follet, their husband and father, ghich causes pain and deep grief. They do not easlly accept the death, but it is the fact that they have to face. Therefore the writer becomes interested in discussing it. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the inner and outer conflicts that Hary Follet and Rufus Follet face in their lives after Jay Follet's death. To see the conflicts, the writer uses the theory of conflict. Both of them have their changing attitudes as a way and process in accepting the death. Mary can accept the reality through her inner and outer conflicts, while Rufus can understand through his outer and inner conflicts too. The thesis writer concludes that with some outer helps, a person can change his or her attitudes so that finally he or she can accept the loss of his or her loved one.",
