  "title": "The Use of black English vernacular by Gina, the black man main character in beauty shop film, viewed from solidarity and ethnicity factors",
  "abstract": "Black English Vernacular is often found in television, radio and in daily life conversation. However, many non-English speaking students are not familiar with that because they only learn about Standard English in school. The writer wants to know the types of BEV linguistic items and the frequency of BEV linguistic items produced by Gina, a black main character in ?Beauty Shop? film and tries to relate it to the factors of solidarity and ethnicity to the addressees. In analyzing the data, the writer uses Trudgill?s (1983) theory of Black English Vernacular varieties and Labov?s (1972) theory of Black English Vernacular linguistic items. Also, the writer uses the theory from Holmes (1992) about the factors of solidarity and ethnicity in affecting someone?s speech. The writer classifies the utterances into the BEV linguistic items and analyses the addressees? relationship with Gina. The result shows that there are some types of BEV linguistic features frequently are used and some features do not occur in Gina?s speech. Also, the writer found that solidarity and ethnicity affect Gina?s speech, but the solidarity factor plays a more important role in making Gina produce more BEV. Also, the writer found that not all the BEV linguistic items occur in Gina?s speech even though she speaks BEV.",
