  "title": "A Marketing booklet: a solution to cope with the unclear identity of High Point Serviced Apartment",
  "abstract": "Based on my internship experience at High Point Serviced Apartment in Surabaya, I found that many people were confused with the identity of High Point, because its name is a serviced apartment but it operates like a hotel. This problem leads to customer confusion and many people do not know about High Point. As a result, the occupancy rate in High Point is not as high as expected. Therefore, I decided to make a marketing booklet which contains company overview, product description, and company address. The company overview which contains brief information about High Point will help to clarify the unclear identity, while the product description which contains detailed information about its products and services will help to promote their products and services. Besides that, the benefit of this marketing booklet for High Points that it can help to clarify High Pointâ€™s identity and can help High Point to get new customers.",
