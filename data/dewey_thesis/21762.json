  "title": "Different perceptions on marriage and working in Ray lawler's Summer of the Seventeenth Doll",
  "abstract": "Olive is approaching forty, the daughter of Emma who likes to celebrate the lay-off seasons. She has different perception during the lay-off with the other characters. I emphasize my research in revealing the different perception between Olive and the other characters. The main purpose of this study is to reveal the different perception on marriage and working between Olive, Roo, Barney and Pearl character in Ray Lawler's Summer of the Seventeenth Doll. Moreover, I use the theory of characterization and conflict for revealing the different perception on marriage and working. Next, I find out that there is different perception between Olive, Roo, Pearl and Barney. Olive and Barney think that marriage is unimportant, which is contrast to Pearl. Olive and the male characters, Roo and Barney, also have different perception on working. Therefore I want to show how different perceptions affect Olive, Pearl, Barney, and Roo relationship. Furthermore, I also find in the analysis that the different perception and characterization broken Olive, Pearl, Barney and Roo relationship.",
