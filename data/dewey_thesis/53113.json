  "title": "Rhetorical devices used by Simon Sinek when delivering an inspirational speech",
  "abstract": "This study was conducted to find out the rhetorical devices used by Simon Sinek when delivering an inspirational speech and how they affect Simon Sinek’s inspirational speech. In this study, the writer used Harris’ (2018) theory of rhetorical question and Gregory’s (2018) theory of general purposes of speech to analyze the data. This study was done using a descriptive qualitative approach. The findings showed that Simon Sinek uses alliteration, parallelism, antithesis, and simile when delivering his speech. However, the writer does not find metaphor in Sinek’s inspirational speech because metaphor allows different interpretations, and while it is a strength in literature works, it is a weakness in a speech since it decreases the level of clarity in a speech. Each rhetorical devices affect the speech differently. Alliteration affects the speech using melody; parallelism with repetition and rhythm; antithesis with contrast, complexity, balance, and emphasis; and simile with vivid image, sense of familiarity, and clarity. Ultimately, rhetorical devices affect the inspirational speech in a positive way as they help amplify the meaning of the speech.",
