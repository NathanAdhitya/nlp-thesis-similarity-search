  "title": "Kidnap: exploring guilt and its impacts towards individuality",
  "abstract": "Crime films nowadays usually focus on solving criminal cases or exploring the story of the victim. This creative work that I make, however, follows the story of a criminal who is given a mission to kidnap the successor of a wealthy CEO but mistakenly kidnaps another person instead. He is captured in a dilemma whether or not to let her go, and his situation only gets worse when he is given a new order to kill her. The story will revolve around the criminal as his own personal life slowly unravels and the true motive behind his criminal behavior is revealed. With the boundary of good and bad being questioned as the main topic, this work will hopefully remind people to be less judgmental and to think twice before throwing a label over a person. The main theme that is used in this work is how guilt changes a person’s personality and way of thinking. This represents the criminal’s emotional state at the moment, in which he is currently overwhelmed by his past guilt that clouded his judgment towards his actions. To further understand how guilt works its way in the criminal’s mind, the psychology of guilt is used as the main theory in this work. The story is presented through the genre psychological suspense, as this genre and its conventions suits the style of this creative work which focuses on a crime and the complexity within it.",
