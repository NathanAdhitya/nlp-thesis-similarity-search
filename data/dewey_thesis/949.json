  "abstract": "The thesis is about the main characters, Mark and Jane Studdock, who have some problems in their marriage. Mark and Jane are unhappy with their marriage. Both of them have their own problems that influence their relationship in marriage. I will analyze their unhappy marriage life through finding out the causes of the problems from both of them. In analyzing the topic, I uses library research and the internet to help me in getting more data. The literary approach that I use is the literary theories of conflict and characterization. I also need some important terms pertaining to marriage. In thesis, I will analyze the causes of the marriage problems from Jane and Mark. I conclude that they are unhappy mostly because of the lack of communication.",
