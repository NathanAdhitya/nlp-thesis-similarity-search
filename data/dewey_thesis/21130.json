  "title": "A Study of some E.E. Cummings' poems through discourse analysis",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study which analyzes e.e.cummings'poems.The writer chooses only eight poems considering that they are the most famous ones and still remain questions for her.She questions what the poems are about,what they say to the readers.This happens because cummings employs 'typography'in most of his poems,like unique shapes, punctuations,the use of white spaces and so on.The interpretation of the poems seems difficult to achieve,as the result. The writer feels challenged to find the answer to this problem.She then further analyzes the poems through discourse analysis with a focus on the study of the coherence of the eight chosen poems.By applying this linguistic approach,she hopes to be able to show the readers what makes cummings'poems coherent and how the poems finally make sense for them. It is clearly shown in the analysis,that the writer is able to make a closer approach to the study of literature through the linguistic approach. Cummings'poems are proved to be coherent and this enables the writer and other readers of his poems to arrive at the interpretation,at what the poet intended to convey to his readers through his poems.",
