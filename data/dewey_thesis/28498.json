  "title": "The Interactional styles used by business women to their business-husbands with lower and higher career positions",
  "abstract": "In this thesis, I did a research about the types and the frequencies of interactional styles used by the businesswomen when talking to their business-husbands who have higher and lower career positions than they are. I also studied the differences and the similarities found in the use of these interactional styles in their husbands-wives conversations. The data is 20 conversational-transcripts from 20 couples of businesswomen and business-husbands. Further, I used Holmesâ€™ theory of interactional styles as my main theory to analyze the data. To gain the data itself, I used a pre experimental-qualitative method which is complemented by a descriptive analysis. Besides, I used a role play as my instrument which enabled me to get a natural data. Later, in the findings and discussion I found out five results. Finally, the conclusion is that social status gives power for those who own it. Later, this power has become an influential factor to determine how businesswomen interact with their husbands. Power determines the way businesswomen speak and the way they speak reflects the power that they have.",
