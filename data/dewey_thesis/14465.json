  "title": "A Study on the effect of Tom and Sophia's relationship as seen in the conflicts due to their different social backgrounds in Fielding's Tom Jones",
  "abstract": "In maintaining a love relationship, people usually face a lot of obstacles especially when the couple do not come from the same social background. This did not only happen in the eighteenth century. In the twentienth century a couple may still face the same problems. Therefore, the writer of this thesis is curious to know the conflicts, outer and internal conflicts experienced by the main characters, Tom and Sophia in Henry Fielding's Tom Jones. In analyzing the conflicts, the writer observes Tom and Sophia's relationship with other characters since through their relationship, the writer will understand whether they can get along socially or get conflits. At the end of this thesis, she comes to a conclusion that a love relationship of people from different social status will not be free from conflicts. However, it does not mean that people should not have a love relationship with partners from different social backgrounds. Conversely, they should face and solve their problems.",
