  "title": "A Study of Mrs. Pike's reactions toward tragedy and toward depression in Anne Tyler's the tin can tree",
  "abstract": "The two aspects which are seen through Anne Tyler' The Tin Can Tree are the depression and the survival of Mrs. Pike after her daughter's death. The analysis is focused on Mrs. Pike's depression, the event which causes her depression, her reactions toward depression, and the internal and external factors that change her attitude to have a normal life again. To see the depression and the survival the thesis writer uses literary approach, that is the theory of characterization. She also uses some psychological theories on depression to support the analysis. The thesis writer concludes that the important factors for people to survive are both encouragement from other people and self motivation. Encouragement and sympathy from others are needed to help the depressed people to face the tragedy. Self motivation is necessary so that the person can accept the fact and continue his or her life as normally as before.",
