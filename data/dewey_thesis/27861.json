  "abstract": "This research observed the compliments given by a female piano teacher in Symphonia Music School to high-, mid- and low- ability students. The data were obtained by audio-recording one meeting of each student considered to have different ability. The data were analyzed using the theory of Compliment (Holmes, 1988) and Exchange Structure (Coulthart, 1992). The findings showed that the student of high-ability tended to be complimented the most while the student of mid-ability got the least compliments. Although this student got the least compliments, he and high-ability student got more varied tokens than the low-ability student during the lesson. Meanwhile, among all students, the high- ability student got the least non-compliment feedbacks while student of mid ability got the most. Student of high and low ability got the criticism as their most non-compliment feedbacks while student of mid ability often did not receive any feedback from the teacher. Therefore, it could be concluded that studentsâ€™ ability somehow influenced the way the teacher gave feedbacks, either by giving compliment or other feedbacks.",
