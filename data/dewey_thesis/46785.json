  "abstract": "It is a study of Hokkian - Ing Chun address terms used by Hokkian - Ing Chun Chinese - Indonesian people in Samarinda. I would like to know what address terms used in Hokkian - Ing Chun families are and how age, sex, and relationship affect the choice of address terms by Hokkian - Ing Chun people in addressing within the family, among relatives, strangers and friends. The knowledge about kinship relationship in family and the factors that influence in addressing someone is useful information to support my study to do this research. That is why I use Beals’, Holmes’, and Brown and Gilman’s theories. I use a descriptive approach, some interviews and observations for this study. The analysis is about Hokkian - Ing Chun address terms within the family, from father’s and mother’s family, strangers-to-strangers and friends-to-friends. I found out that there are many kinds of Hokkian - Ing Chun address terms. Moreover, age, sex, and relationship affect the choice of address terms by Hokkian - Ing Chun people in addressing their families, relatives, strangers and friends. However, in not common situation, different generation may influence the choice of address terms within the family and among relatives. Power and solidarity may also affect the decision to address conditions among strangers and friends.",
