  "title": "When church whispers exploring how gossips ruin a church",
  "abstract": "Christians’ behaviors of gossiping may have been the main reason of many churches’ conflicts and separations in Indonesia. In order to help Christians see and be aware of it, this creative work that I make, explores and discusses the process of how gossips that is seemingly a trivial issue, can eventually ruin a church. This project will let the readers know that gossip is a gossip only when there are people who respond to it; just as how without air, fire goes out, that is gossip goes out without its approval. Basically, the story will revolve around the gossiper, those who respond to it, and how they collaborate together to eventually ruin the church. Also, by using satire as its genre, this creative works let Christians do a self reflection through the story of the sarcastic comedy. It gives Christians opportunities to laugh at themselves seeing the foolishness and the corruption of their behaviors. Also by using the theory of why people do gossip and also what the negative effects of gossips are, the play will let the readers further understand the behaviors of gossiping.",
