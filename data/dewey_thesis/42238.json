  "title": "Recommended changes to ADK INSIGHTS' current customer segmentation process model to produce an output that better reflects distinctive market segments and meets clients' expectations",
  "abstract": "With globalization and the advancement of technology, market and customer behavior have changed a lot. Globalization had a big impact in changing people's life. The cultural barriers have been lessened, which leads researchers to believe that the behaviors of individuals from different cultures are becoming more compatible or similar. The objective of this research project is to help ADK INSIGHTS to redesign their customer segmentation process model. The author studied the literature about customer segmentation, interviewed ADK INSIGHTS' managers, performed desk research on how competitors do customer segmentation and interviewed clients of ADK INSIGHTS to understand what customer segmentation result they expect in the future",
