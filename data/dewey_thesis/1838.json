  "title": "The Refusal expressions used by five chinese indonesian female adults in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "My study is on refusal expressions used by five Chinese Indonesian female adults in Surabaya. The reason why I have this topic is that I am curious to know how five Chinese Indonesian female adults in Surabaya refuse someone?s offer or invitation because refusal expression is very complicated and sometimes it makes misunderstanding to the hearer. Therefore, I want to know what types of refusal that are dominantly used by five Chinese Indonesian female adults in Surabaya. I use George Yule?s theory and adopt Beebe and Takahashi?s method. In gathering the data, I used five Chinese Indonesian female adults as my respondents. I use a descriptive qualitative research. I find that the type of the refusal expressions used by five Chinese Indonesian female adults in Surabaya is mostly explanation or reason. I also find that they still feel reluctant to refuse someone?s offer or invitation. All of my respondents have different characteristics in refusing someone?s offer or invitation. Such custom as family background or behaviour in the society can indirectly influence them in using refusal expression.",
