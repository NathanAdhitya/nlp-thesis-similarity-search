  "title": "A Study of David's realization of an ideal wife through his marriages as seen in Dickens's David Copperfield",
  "abstract": "This thesis deals with David?s realization on ideal woman in Dickens?s David Copperfield. I want to know how David finally realizes what an ideal woman for him is by analyzing each of the character traits of David, Dora, and Agnes. Thus, in doing the analysis I use the theory of characterization and conflict. David irrationally falls in love with Dora, so he cannot control his blinded love and he marry her. Meanwhile, Dora, is not as perfect as what David thinks as his wife. David?s blinded love causes his outer and inner conflicts in his first marriage. After David starts to think that both of his conflicts are only caused by his blinded love, then he realizes that an ideal wife is not someone like he thinks before. In the conclusion, I find out that Dora?s and Agnes?s character traits give strong influence to the main character: David, to have the realization of an ideal wife for him.",
