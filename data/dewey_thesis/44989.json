  "title": "Understanding the justice in Agatha Christie's Murder on The Orient Express",
  "abstract": "This thesis deals with the understanding of justice in the novel. Through this analysis, I want to understand whether the judge brought up by the story is as same as the concept of justice in real-world or it is a different idea proposed by the author. I use the theory of retributive justice and two supporting theories about morality and code of conducts of private investigators. In this analysis, I analyze two characters who have strong reasons for helping me understand justice. I examine Hercule Poirot because he is the main character and also symbolizes justice due to his moral choice in the story. Next, I analyze Linda Arden because she is the mastermind and has a stable emotional scar to bring out her point of view of justice. The conclusion that can be found in this analysis is that truth in retribution includes an action that precedes the legal procedure. It can justify some action outside the written constitutional law.",
