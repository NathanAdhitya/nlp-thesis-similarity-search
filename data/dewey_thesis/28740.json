  "abstract": "This thesis emphasis guilt as the main issue portrayed in Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner through its main character, Amir. Amir’s guilt and the way he deals with them will be the aim of this research. Guilt is produced when a person finds his behavior has turned to be a failure will be the definition used to discuss Amir’s guilt. Also I find that Burke’s concept that guilt is created from a failure in following the social standard is suitable to analyze Amir’s guilty feelings. It also suitable to discuss the way Amir deals with his guilt since it needs to be redeemed even through suffering. In the study, I discover that Amir bears three kinds of guilt. The first is Amir’s personal guilt to Hassan which comes from his failure in acknowledging Hassan as a friend. The second is Amir’s familial guilt which comes from his father’s sin to Hassan and his family. The third is Amir’s societal guilt which resulted from the history of his tribe and Hassan’s tribe. The analysis also shows that self-sacrificing are the way Amir deals with his guilt.",
