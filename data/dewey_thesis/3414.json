  "title": "A Study of Ian Bedloe's depression and how he overcomes it in Anne Tyler's Saint Maybe",
  "abstract": "Saint maybe is the 13 th novel written by Anne Tyler. Saint Maybe is an amazing story, which tells about a man, namely Ian Bedloe. Ian Bedloe as the main character of the story is involved in a tragedy which leads to a depression and needs to find a way to overcome his depression. He experiences guilty feeling and results in depression. Therefore, I want to know the factors of Ian Bedloe?s depression and the efforts that he does to overcome it. I analyze the factors and the efforts using literary approach namely characterization and conflict which are also supported by psychological theories: the theory of guilty feeling and depression. Through the analysis, I find out that Ian Bedloe can overcome his depression. However before that, he has experienced several stages in facing his tragedy. There are supporting factors that make him able to overcome his depression: the internal and external factors. Finally, it can be concluded that the guilty feeling that causes depression is something to be faced; asking for forgiveness is an excellent way to overcome this problem, as what Ian Bedloe has done.",
