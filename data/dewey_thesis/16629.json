  "title": "Service quality study of PT Duta Bayu Citra Surabaya",
  "abstract": "The growth of technology develops so quickly. One of the innovations coming up so fast is the car Air Conditioner invented a long time ago. Yet, the existence of Air Conditioner distributors in Surabaya causes tight competition. The competition includes price, product quality, and service, so the distributor must give a good Air Conditioner product and serve the customers well as possible; thus, the distributor can exist and even face the competition. Reviewing related literature, the writers use the theory of service quality, consisting of five dimensions ( Tangible, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, and Empathy) and consumers' perception. This research needs data and information from 2 sources, that is: Primary data is obtained through questionnaires to customers, and secondary information is obtained from library research by collecting related data. The result from distributing questionnaires states that Pt. Duta Bayu Citra Surabaya, the Air Conditioner distributor that the 'writers survey, has satisfied the customers through dimensions (Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness Assurance, and Empathy).",
