  "title": "CYBERDESPAIR: a screenplay raising awareness of social media addiction",
  "abstract": "This thesis is created with the purpose to raise awareness in social media addiction and how it affects the people we are close with in reality starting through a screenplay. Social media is commonly used by everyone in this modern era, but not a lot of users are aware of the danger and risk it can bring to our mental health. Social media addiction is an unhealthy reliance on online platforms and it is the overuse and difficult in quitting just like any other addictions do. By using Erik Erikson’s psychological development theory, this thesis will explore the reasons, causes and effects on why an individual might be addicted to social media. It will emphasize using the fourth, fifth, sixth as well as the final stage of Erikson’s psychological development stages to support the story building of the screenplay and how social media addiction can lead to disparity in our lives. Using screenplay as the creative form and modern tragedy as its genre, this thesis will show the story of Nathan and Sydney’s in their social media addiction and how eventually the two characters end up crossing paths in the real world.",
