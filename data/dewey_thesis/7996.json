  "abstract": "Schneider Electric Indonesia Ltd. is applying Lean Manufacturing to all its manufacturing process and also to its assembly process to keep improving both their production quality and production quantity. This Final Project Assignment is about making MTM-UAS analysis in the assembly process in Switch assembly line which is consist of 5 work stations. The MTM-UAS analysis is made for each work station, and made based on Work Instruction and a video recording. It is useful to know the Useful Time (UT) and also determine the Design Coefficient (KD) in Switch assembly line. The MTM-UAS flowchart is made using the MTM 2003 software. Improvements to its work station are made from the result of its KD. The improvements are made to work station that have KD below 0.7-0.8. It is found that there are 3 work stations that have KD below 0.7-0.8 from a total of 5 work stations in Switch assembly line. Improvements then made to those work stations. Improvements were made by eliminating the NAV (non added value) cyclic elements so that the NAV time could be reduced. From the improvements, the NAV time in work station 1, 10, and 11 could be reduced to 30.60% in work station 1, 18.43% in work station 10, and 33.74% in work station 11.",
