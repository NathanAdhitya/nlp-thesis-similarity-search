  "title": "A dream to live: a screenplay exploring the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and how to overcome it",
  "abstract": "Fear is an instinctive reaction of the human body to a possible \"threatening\" situation. Fight or flight is a type of reaction that enables people to avoid or respond to threats. Those who could not thrive well might turn their responses to threats into trauma. As this creative work is intended to raise mental health awareness in society, in particular about post-traumatic stress disorder and how to overcome it—this work will fall into the category of a psychological drama. The creative work would be in the form of screenplay and is going to depict Asna’s psychological condition, who is struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms after a tragic accident that leads her to have a limb amputation. Throughout her journey to overcome post-traumatic stress disorder, she goes to the psychotherapist and eventually takes the chance to pursue her dream.",
