  "title": "Alex’s perceptions of her roles in Divortiare Trilogy",
  "abstract": "This thesis aims to reveal Alex’s way of prioritizing her career as single woman or divorcee and Alex strategies for being a good wife in Ika Natassa’s Divortiare trilogy. I am going to analyze Alex’s life with women’s roles theory related to patriarchal ideology in Indonesia. I will use the concept of traditional feminine roles in order to reveal Alex’s strategies for being a good wife. In discussing Alex’s role, I am dividing the analysis into two parts. The first part discusses Alex’s way to prioritize her career and her reason why she prioritizes it. The second part explains her strategies for being a good wife in her second marriage. Also, I find that Alex does her work so hard in order to prove that she can survive and be successful by her own. I also find that she embraces the traditional feminine roles in order to get a happy marriage. Therefore, she enjoys her life as a married woman rather than a successful single woman.",
