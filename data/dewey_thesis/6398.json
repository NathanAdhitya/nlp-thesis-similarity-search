This study is about Interruption and Overlap found in interaction between the teacher and children on Sunday school class of sector seven in East Java Christian Church The writer would like to find out who interrupt or overlap more in the conversation among boys and girls, what reasons used by the children to interrupt or overlap that occurs in the conversation and Which reason used the most either by the boys and girls. Based on Wardhaugh?s theory, someone may have some reason to interrupt or overlap in the conversation. Those reasons are asking for help, seek clarification, requesting for clarification or repetition, correcting, disagreeing and rejecting some points. The writer used the descriptive approach to her study by collecting the data of spoken form of the conversation between the children and the teacher. The findings of the study show that boys interrupt and overlap more than girls. The most reason of interruption that produced by boys is requesting a repetition and the most reason of overlap that produced by boys is for seeking clarification.",
