  "title": "The Effects of corporate reputation and its determinants on corporate performance: evidence from Indonesia",
  "abstract": "This research investigates the effects of corporate reputation on performance, as well as, determining whether corporate governance and earnings management can be determinants of reputation and have direct effects on performance in Indonesia. The research model is empirically tested with data from 44 publically listed companies, averaged from year 2012-2016. After using Partial Least Squares (PLS), the results show that corporate reputation has strong positive effects on performance. Corporate governance has negative affects on earnings management and both are found to be determinants of reputation as well as performance. Each of the relationship is discussed in relation to theory and its managerial implications.",
