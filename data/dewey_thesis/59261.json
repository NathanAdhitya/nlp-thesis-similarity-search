  "abstract": "In this study, I want to analyze a movie that came from a series made by Hasbro, which is titled Transformers, directed by Michael Bay. The movie is the very first one which is made into a live action movie while all the previous titles are all animated, and/or comic book adaptations. In my study, I found out that the conflict between the human characters and the cyborg characters in the movie revolve around discrimination which is caused by the conflict itself. I would also like to explore what are the kinds of discrimination within the movie so that I can determine the cause of it and with the research, to learn about not to discriminate. For the analysis of my study, I will use the theory of Posthumanism by Cary Wolfe, which implies that the process of Posthuman transformation includes cyborg enhancements to improve the capabilities of human beings. I also found that from these so-called cyborg enhancements, comes discrimination from the people who think negatively towards the process of the enhancements, and thus discriminate against them. This also relates to the Transformers movie where the cyborg characters are discriminated against by the humans due to their differences with and against each other. I also found that within the movie, there is a type of conflict which is the external conflict, and also there are two types of discrimination which are social discrimination and rights discrimination.",
