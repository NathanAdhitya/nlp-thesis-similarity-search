  "title": "Word formation on slang words in boost's Instagram captions and posts targeting teenagers",
  "abstract": "The study analyzed captions and posts in Boostâ€™s Instagram that utilizes English slangs to communicate to the target market. It used the theories of types of word formation processes by Yule (2006) and that by Minkova and Stockwell (2009). The findings found only the following types of word formation processes: coinage, compounding, blending, clipping, conversion, acronym, derivation, other sources, and multiple processes, with acronym as the most commonly used. Obviously, borrowing and backformation are the types of word formation processes that were not found in the data. It may also be concluded that the use of a certain type of word formation processes may be influenced by the targeted reader.",
