  "title": "Pre-sequence used by english departement students and their interlocutors in daily conversation",
  "abstract": "This study is about pre-sequence, utterances which are usually used before announcing, arranging, inviting, requesting and closing something. More specifically, this study focused on the conversations of three English Department students with intimate and distant interlocutors. The writer would like to know whether there was any difference in using the pre-sequence between the students and the two kinds of interlocutors when they were having conversations. In analyzing the data, she used Levinson?s (1983) theory of pre-sequence and its classification. For the findings, the writer found that all types of pre-sequence, that is, pre-announcement, pre-arrangement, pre-invitation, pre-request and pre-closing, were used by the students and their interlocutors, the intimates and the distants. Furthermore, pre-request was used more frequently between the intimates. Meanwhile, pre-announcement was used more frequently by the subjects and the distant interlocutors. Besides, the writer also found that both the intimates and the distants used almost the same total numbers of pre-sequence. Hence, the writer could conclude that the stereotype about intimates that tended to use direct utterances, and distants that tended to use indirect utterances did not really happen in this study.",
