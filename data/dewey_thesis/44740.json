  "title": "The Factors that may attract Petra Christian University students as a new target market to visit Seventeen Skyview Resto & Lounge of HARRIS-POP! Hotels & Conventions on weekdays",
  "abstract": "Seventeen Skyview Resto & Lounge is a restaurant located on the 17th floor of HARRIS-POP! Hotels & Conventions. The main target market of this restaurant is the general public with middle to upper-class income. The competitors of this restaurant are other restaurants located in hotels all around Surabaya. The main problem of this restaurant is regarding the low number of customers coming on weekdays. The gap between the number of customers coming on weekdays and weekends is becoming huger every day. Thus, I decided to conduct in-depth research to identify the factors that can be used to attract a new target market to come to this restaurant on weekdays to solve this problem. The main tool I use in this research is the questionnaire form, and the main respondents are the fifty students from seventeen different majors in Petra Christian University. The outcome of this research is a research report as the summary of the questionnaire formsâ€™ results. This research report will be a beneficial tool for the restaurant to understand the needs and wants of the students of Petra Christian University, as the new potential target market for this restaurant to come on weekdays.",
