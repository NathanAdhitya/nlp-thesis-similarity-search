  "title": "Mort raineys split personality in secret window",
  "abstract": "Psychological issue is the main issue discussed in David Koepp’s Secret Window through its main character, Mort Rainey. Rainey’s psychological struggle in coping with his traumatic experience will be the main theme in this research. Therefore, this thesis examines Rainey’s split personality. Furthermore, in this study, I want to analyze the process of how Mort Rainey’s personality splits into two different personalities as the way to cope with this traumatic experience. To meet the answer of this study, I will use the theory of Split Personality or Dissociative Identity Disorder with a support from Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalysis theory about the three psyche agents (id, ego, and superego). In this study, I discover that the process of Mort Rainey’s split personality begins with a traumatic experience, then continued with the repression and compartmentalization to create an alter, John Shooter. The exploration of the alter formation results in finding the ways John Shooter helps Mort Rainey to cope with his traumatic experience. Finally, the split personality that Mort Rainey experiences is useful as a great defense for Mort Rainey to cope with his trauma.",
