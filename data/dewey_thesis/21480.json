  "abstract": "The title \" A study of Dombey's conflicts in Charles Dick-ens's Dombev and Son sounds very interesting. This thesis is examining the elements of conflict since it is known that conflict is the essence of every narrative. A literary work without conflict is unthinkable. Conflict makes the story interesting and creates suspense.In this novel, conflict appears among Dombey and Edith, Florence, Paul, Carker, and Walter. The writer uses conflicts as her study in this thesis. She finds that at the beginning of the novel the major character, Dombey, puts his pride of being the owner of Dombey and Son higher than everything else, such as : love and affection. But his pride changes to humility at the end of the novel. When he finds out that a pride that he thinks can make him happy destroys his life, therefore he regrets and changes his attitude at the end of the novel.",
