  "title": "A Study of bigger Thomas' finding of his self-identity in Richard Wright's native son",
  "abstract": "The thesis writer uses Native Son as the material to study about self-identity to find out that environment has an important influence in shaping someone's identity. The study is conducted by applying theory of characterization and conflict to help her describe the main character, Bigger Thomas, in finding his identity in the society. The theory of conflict is used to clarify how Bigger Thomas finds his self-identity in his conflicts with his society. The society where Bigger lives forces him to find out his identity because he feels that he does not belong to the society, the white or even the black. Bigger Thomas finds his self-identity through the violent act he has done. To reveal the identity set of Bigger Thomas, the thesis writer uses the term of self-identity and the concept of social animal. Finally, the writer concludes that an environment determines someone's identity in the society.",
