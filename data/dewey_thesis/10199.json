  "abstract": "This thesis is a descriptive study of text structure. The writer wants to investigate the genre of language selling and buying in Pasar Atom Surabaya by examining the structure of the text and their language functions. For that purpose, the writer uses Halliday?s (1986) text structure analysis and Van Ek?s (1987) classification of language function as the main theories. The data are taken from the conversation between sellers and buyers who are in the middle of transaction. Nine text structures are analyzed to find their actual structure. The analysis shows that the texts realized some structural patterns. Despite the fact that each text has its own actual structures, they share some common elements of the text such as SI, SE, SP, SR, SC, S, P, NPC, and P. After comparing one text structure with the others, the researcher concludes that the Generic Structure Potential (GSP) of the language of selling and buying in Pasar Atom is [(SI)^] SE. (SP.) (SR.) ^(SC.)^(S.)^(P) (NPC.) [(PC)]. The researcher also found that every element in the text serve for some language functions. Furthermore, it is possible to find more than one function of language in the element. Obligatory element of SE, for example, serves four functions. First is to ask for agreement, second is to ask for actual information, third is to ask for permission, and the last is to request.",
