  "title": "Anna Wulf's self-discrepancy in Doris Lessing's the golden notebook",
  "abstract": "As a free woman, Anna desires to achieve total freedom in her life as a woman. However, on the other side, she also acknowledges the conventional values that are irreconcilable with the image as an emancipated woman that she tries to embrace. These two values that Anna comprehends, lead her to suffer from self-discrepancies in her life. Consequently, in this thesis, I am curious in knowing the reasons why Anna Wulf suffers from self discrepancies as well as the results that they bring to her life as a free woman. This study is aimed to know the reasons of self-discrepancies that Anna experiences and the effects in her life. Moreover, the significance of this study is to reveal women?s struggle as seen through Anna Wulf in freeing herself from the dominant patriarchal ideology. In analyzing the inconsistencies that Anna suffers from, I use Self-Discrepancy theory by E. Tory Higgins. In her life as a free woman, Anna reveals her resistance towards the conventional values whereas on the other side she also experiences anxiety of comprehending the consequences of it. From the self-discrepancies that Anna suffers, a red line can be drawn that in her attempts to become a liberated woman, it appears that she has not been able to fully free herself from the influences of patriarchal ideology. As a result, the conventions greatly affect on how she views her freedom and obstructs her from pursuing a free life.",
