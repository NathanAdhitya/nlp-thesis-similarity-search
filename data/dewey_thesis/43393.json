  "title": "Break time, bully-victim: exploring what makes an individual commit bullying and how it affects him",
  "abstract": "When we talk about bullying, the focus is usually about the victim and exploring how the victim will survive from that and how he overcomes that problem. However, the creative work that I make is different from the usual story. In my original work, the point of view of the story will be from a teenager who commits the bullying. In my account, it will talk about why my main character commits intimidation until he killed his classmate. He does not realize that he is manipulated by his friend and also his upper classmate called Max. The story will reveal why Ronald can become a bully in senior high. The central theme that is used in this work is how guilt changes a personâ€™s personality and way of thinking. His desire to get acknowledgement when he enters senior high and does not want to repeat the same experience in junior high makes him become a bully in senior high. The story is presented through the genre of psychology and focuses on bullying and the story behind it.",
