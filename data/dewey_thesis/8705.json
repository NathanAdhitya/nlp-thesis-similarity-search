  "title": "The study of Katherine's failure in fulfilling the qualities of 'ideal' Elizabethan women in Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\"",
  "abstract": "Katherine is an Elizabethan woman who is considered as a shrew because she fails in fulfilling the qualities of `ideal? women at that time. I want to know what makes Katherine fail to fulfill the qualities of `ideal? Elizabethan women. The aim of this study is to reveal the causes of Katherine?s failure in fulfilling the qualities of `ideal? Elizabethan women. In this study, I use literary approach which focus on characterization and conflict, and feminist theory which focus on gender concept as the supporting. The reason why she fails is because she is not properly educated by her father, and her reaction which is considered as improper reaction towards men. She reacts towards men in such way because she is being provoked. However, Katherine?s failure in fulfilling the qualities of `ideal? is not her fault. Men as the representatives of her society have provoked Katherine by saying negatives words and treated her badly. It is her socialization experiences which construct her become a shrew and fails in fulfilling the qualities of `ideal? Elizabethan women.",
