  "title": "Promoting the online program of EfeX English language center to its target market using a promotional video",
  "abstract": "EfeX English Language Center recently launched a new online division called EfeX Indonesia Maju (IM). Because it is new, EfeX IM has had only a few students since its establishment. This is because EfeX IM has never done any promotion. To solve the problem, first, I used Kalam’s (2022) theory on segmenting, targeting, and positioning, MasterClass’ (2022) theory on product features, and Bhasin’s (2021) and Leonard’s (2022) theory on promotional video. Next, I identified the target market and asked the respondents what they wanted from an online English course. The target market consisted of parents with elementary and middle-school students from families in big cities in Java. The instrument I used to ask 52 parents was a questionnaire. From the target market, I discovered that they needed an online program that is convenient, emphasizes speaking skills, is fun, and is inexpensive. This message is highlighted in the video and the video will be uploaded on Instagram. This tool will certainly be effective and efficient for promotion. EfeX can find it a versatile tool that can be used in WhatsApp, website, and presentation.",
