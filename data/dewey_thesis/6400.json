  "title": "A Comparative study of sentence construction in Psalm 18 of the authorized King James version and the new living translation Bible",
  "abstract": "This study observes the use of simple, coordinated clauses, and subordinated clauses in Psalm 18 of the Authorized King James Version and the New Living Translation Bible. With the assumption that older Bible versions are more complicated than the newer ones, the writer analyzes the sentence constructions of Psalm 18 in the two versions of the Bible. This thesis aims at revealing the way simple, coordinated, and subordinated clauses are used to form the text of Psalm 18 as found in the two Bible versions. Therefore, the writer analyzed the simple, coordinated, and subordinated clauses based on the ideas of simple sentence, coordination, and subordination by Leech, Deuchar and Hoogenraad, and Scott, Bowley, Brockett, Brown and Goddard. The writer uses qualitative descriptive approach in describing and interpreting the sentence constructions of Psalm 18. From this study it is found out that the Authorized King James Version has more coordinated and subordinated clauses than the New Living Translation Bible; while the New Living Translation Bible has more simple clauses than the Authorized King James Version. Through this analysis, the writer expects that the result will help the reader understand the influence of complex sentence constructions in making a sentence more complicated.",
