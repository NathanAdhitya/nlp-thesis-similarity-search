She also wants to find out the factors that cause him to fail as well as how he changes his character. In trying to reveal Lovelace's evil character and to prove that Lovelace fails because of his mistake and of his changing his character, the writer wants to analyse his speeches and attitudes toward other characters as well as other character's opinion about him.
