  "abstract": "This creative project is a narrative poetry which is telling the story of a young adult called Ayu who wants to reach her dream of being an artist. Along the way, she develops an anxiety disorder which is caused by her fatherâ€™s pressure and rejection of her being an artists. Her anxiety disorder then develops into something bigger and worst which is a nervous breakdown or mental breakdown. In this story I choose to write about a mental illness which is anxiety disorder and mental breakdown because I aim to share the awareness of the importance of anxiety disorder and mental breakdown in the society. I aim to show how a person can develop a lot of worse mental illness just from having too much pressure that is being pushed to them from others, especially the family. The family too, I aim to show that a family give the biggest support for each members, that those with anxiety disorders and mental breakdown needs a lot of support so that they will get better and they will not try to find a way out by having a suicidal thoughts and thinking about running away.",
