  "title": "Case study: excel reports improvement by waste and lead time reduction at PT XYZ",
  "abstract": "Generally, a company has its own record of material purchases. The record comes from suppliers in an Excel report format. Subsequently, the record will be processed further by many departments. This means people from Regional Electronics who receive the excel reports firstly from suppliers need to be careful and able to check the excel reports in the shortest lead time possible. It is because any delays or mistakes created by Regional Electronics will impact any departments in the sequence of supply chain process. To anticipate this, improving and standardizing the Excel reporting methods are vital, considering there may be proficiency gaps among the users. Utilizing Excel functions and removing redundant processes (waste) become the key points here to minimize the time lead time. In this thesis, the writer will focus on those two key points using DMAIC method. The writer will test how long it takes to finish a report using the current workflow. From there, the waste and root causes can be identified and eliminated by proposing solutions or improvements.",
