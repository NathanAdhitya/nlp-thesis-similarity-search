  "abstract": "Indonesia is a multicultural society whose linguistic background varies. Each ethnic group has his own culture and has his own way of talking. In this research, the writer tries to investigate the problem of communication, which there may have a different referent between the speaker and listener. The writer uses the theory of discourse in collecting the data, sociolinguistic about code-mixing and Semantic about the referents of the words. The writer finds that the boarders of green house usually produce code-mixings that have a same lexicon but different meaning. The main code of the code-mixing utterances is Indonesian language. There are four kinds of code-mixing utterances, Indonesian-Javanese (I-J), Indonesian-Makassarese (I-M), Indonesian-Banjarese (I-B), and Indonesian-Ambonese (I-A). In Conclusion, The misunderstanding occurs whenever the speaker or the listener mixes the official language and their vernacular language",
