  "title": "Broken compass: a screenplay exploring economic inequality in Indonesia's education system",
  "abstract": "Good quality education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic status. Unfortunately, often better education in Indonesia comes with a heavy price tag that eliminates working class people from being able to afford it. This thesis attempts to explore the economic inequality in Indonesia’s education system because it affects the children and youth of Indonesia, which affects Indonesia’s future. More specifically, to find out why the working class people are economically discriminated and how they face the discrimination. With the form of a screenplay and the young adult dystopian genre, this thesis tries to show the side effects of said economic inequality if taken to the extreme. Using the concept of discrimination and resistance derived from Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of school as cultural reproduction, the working class students, including the protagonist Thalia, are discriminated against by the dominant class because they are seen as threats to their resources. To reciprocate, the discriminated working class students with Thalia challenge the system, which sparks a rebellion inside the school. The worldbuilding aspect of the genre is based on Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of social space, capitals, and agency. Thalia from the working class utilizes her agency to face the discrimination.",
