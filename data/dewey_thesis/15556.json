The writer wants to find out that the America well- known promise of Democracy was not accessible to Black Americans. The analysis therefore deals with three aspect which are the historical reason, the social stereotypes, and the black American position in society as minority class. Later, she will prove the failure of the American democracy through the poems as the social commentary and protest, moreover irony on racism connected to the actual situation of Black American as reflected in the poems. Besides that, the poems can reveal the contradiction between American Democracy which is based on the idea of equality among people and the existence of racism in the light of 350 years. In order to get a clear interpretation of the poems and do the analysis well, the writer of the thesis conducts a library research to find supportive comments from Hughes' critics and use a historical approach to collect data and resources which are based on facts. The poems will also represent black voice of anguish, give spiritual hope and encouragement against racism in order to achieve the goal of a completely equal position.",
