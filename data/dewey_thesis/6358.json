  "abstract": "This thesis deals with the process of the main character?s becoming a fatalist as seen in Franz Kafka?s The Trial. As the tool to help me conduct the analysis, I use the theory of fatalism exercising its elements namely powerlessness and submissiveness. In general, fatalism is a doctrine, a system of philosophy, or a belief that says everything is determined by fate. Basically, the elements explain the stages or process man has to experience in living his destiny. This situation happens to Joseph K. who cannot free himself from the Court. First of all, the Court tries to make him realize that he is powerless through the work of its emissaries and intermediaries. Despite the pressures he gets from the Court, K. at first, tries to defend himself and struggle to win the case by searching for help. Nevertheless, K.?s efforts always meet a dead end and his case gets even worse. Therefore, despite all his attempts to defend himself, K. is forced to realize that he is powerless against the Court. In the end, it finally dawns on him that he cannot escape his destiny, and, thus, submits himself entirely into the hands of the Court. In this stage, K. totally becomes submissive in facing the Court until he is killed `like a dog?.",
