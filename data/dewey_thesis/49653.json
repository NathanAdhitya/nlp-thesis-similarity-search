The regression data panel was used in this study to test 27 samples of retail companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the period 2015-2019. In order to test the hypothesis proposed in this study, one of the regression data panels, fixed effect model, is used as a statistical approach that corresponds to the characteristics of the data.
