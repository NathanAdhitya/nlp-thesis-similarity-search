  "title": "Efficiency enhancement in financial statement preparation: leveraging visual basic for applications to save time",
  "abstract": "The research question addressed in this undergraduate thesis is to what extent Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) can be utilized to expedite the process of creating financial statements from Excel data. The objective was to investigate the effectiveness of utilizing VBA in reducing the time required for financial statement preparation. The study involved implementing VBA automation techniques to streamline the generation of financial statements and comparing the time taken for manual creation versus automated creation along with the calculations of the financial impact VBA automation. The research methodology involved conducting a series of experiments where financial statements were manually prepared from Excel data, followed by the implementation of VBA automation techniques for the same task. The time required for each approach was measured, and a comparative analysis was performed. The results of the study demonstrated that utilizing Visual Basic for Applications significantly reduced the time required to create financial statements.",
