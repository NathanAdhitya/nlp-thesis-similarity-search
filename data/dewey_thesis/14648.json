  "abstract": "The development of women?s literature results in the booming of chick lit in today?s world. Chick lit, which focus on the subject of women, also becomes popular since it is topping to bestseller around the world and being adopted into movies and series. I choose Candace Bushnell?s Sex and the City to analyze based on my interest to discuss about the topic of singleness. This novel also has the social background of contemporary aspects in which I can comprehend more. Furthermore, I will discuss how the meaning of singleness changes historically and how the meanings of singleness are reflected through the single women in Sex and the City. The feminist theory, particularly third wave feminist values, will be used to analyze the changes that subsist. The analysis shows changes in terms, roles, and experiences of single women. However, the meanings of singleness in the present bring the new concept of having it all to subsist. In this concept, the social demand for single women still exist in the way that single women want to have both world of singleness and marriage life. It also proves that even there is the change paradigm of single women, the society still remains unchangeable.",
