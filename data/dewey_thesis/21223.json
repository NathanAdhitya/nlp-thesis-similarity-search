  "title": "A Study on the main female character of Tennessee Williams' summer and smoke",
  "abstract": "In Summer and Smoke.Tennessee Williams reveals the negative side of the dominant influence of environment . How the environment has trapped someone into a complex conflict.Through Alma,the main female character, Williams portrays a figure of a woman who faces many kinds of conflicts as the consequences of her status as the daughter of a minister,her faith as a puritan and her regional background as a Southern lady.Since she is brought up in a faithful family,Alma concerns more to her conduct than her feeling.She tends to fulfill her spiritual satisfaction rather than her physical desire.Helped by John,Alma realizes that she will feel lonely if she still upholds her old way of living. At the end of the play,Alma accepts the request of a young salesman to go to a casino,a place that symbolize sin in her religion.Thus her acceptance of the offer reflects her rejection of her old way of life and her belief in the puritan's doctrine.",
