  "title": "A Marketing booklet: a way to promote SWK 95 Hotel to its prospects and customers",
  "abstract": "SWK 95 Hotel is a new budget hotel located near Petra Christian University. As a new hotel, SWK 95 is only known by a few people in certain areas. Moreover, there are two other hotels which are older and bigger than SWK 95 Hotel. Therefore, it is better for SWK 95 Hotel to start targeting companies and travel agencies. To accomplish this goal, SWK 95 Hotel needs to have a marketing tool which can promote it to many people and get more customers. To solve that problem, I decided to make a marketing booklet which contains five parts: table of contents, company overview (“About SWK 95”), products (“Room Types”), Facilities (“Facilities”), and contact information. The company overview part will help SWK 95 Hotel to introduce its hotel to the prospects. Moreover, in the product part, there are products description and a table of price list which can help SWK 95 Hotel to promote its product to its prospects and customers. By having these information, the marketing booklet will be able to reach more customers, especially companies and travel agencies. Of course by reaching those customers, SWK 95 Hotel will get more opportunity to get more customers and survive. Finally, it can help SWK 95 Hotel to develop its hotel and become a big hotel.",
