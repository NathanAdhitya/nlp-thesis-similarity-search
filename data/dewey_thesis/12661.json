  "title": "Feminism in Thomas Hardy's a laodicean",
  "abstract": "This thesis deals mainly with the thesis writer's hypothesis that Thomas Hardy's central female character in A Laodicean reflects the characteristics of a feminist. By using some criticism on A Laodicean and by doing characterization of Paula Power, the thesis writer will show that she is a feminist. The characteristics that prove that Paula Power is a feminist, Are the following: Paula is a modern type of woman, firm, educated and outspoken, very independent, and highly principled. The thesis writer then concludes that Paula Power shows her being a feminist in every area of her life: in religion, education, marriage, principle, tradition, and possession.",
