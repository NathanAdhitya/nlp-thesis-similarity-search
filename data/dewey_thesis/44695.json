  "title": "Deformation and failure of treated sugarcane bagasse reinforced polypropylene composite",
  "abstract": "Biocomposite was made from sugarcane bagasse fibres reinforced with a matrix of polypropylene (PP) using extrusion and injection moulding. Two different sugarcane bagasse fibers-PP were prepared; the first sample used treated sugarcane bagasse. Sugarcane bagasse fibres were treated using five wt. % NaOH in room temperature with one hour soaking time in order to increase the strength of the fibre. The second sample with untreated sugarcane bagasse but Maleated Polypropylene (MAPP) as coupling agent was added. The composition of the composites was changed in 5 wt. % step from the range of 0 and 30 wt. % sugarcane bagasse. Mechanical properties were evaluated using tensile and impact testing. Scanning electron micrographs were performed to see the structure of the composite. The results show that the addition of MAPP increases fibre-matrix adhesion effectively compared than fibre modification alone. The MAPP increases the tensile strength of the composites up to 58% with maximum tensile strength obtained is 34,82 MPa. However, the impact resistance of the composites with MAPP (2.51-3.28 kJ/m2) is lower than composites prepared with treated fibres (3.15-4.61 kJ/m2). SEM micrographs confirm the debonding and pullout of fibres on the samples without MAPP and fracture of fibre on the samples with MAPP.",
