  "abstract": "Bagasse ash and Carbide waste are the residues of industrial processed which are not used. Previous research shows that the mix of bagasse ash and carbide waste with ratio of 1:3 will increase the ability and strength of sand. This research presents the effect of addition of portland cement (PC) to the strength and durability of sands, bagasse ash and carbide waste mixture. The effect of curing method to the durability and strength of samples were also observed. The result shows that the strength of the sample increases with the addition of PC. Besides, by the addition of PC to the mixture also increases the durability of sample to weathering.",
