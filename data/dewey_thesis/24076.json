  "title": "The Problems of incestuous love as tragic flaw in John Ford 'tis pity she's a whore",
  "abstract": "It is obvious that tragic flaw causes unbearable pity and terror when it deals with human. What seems to be obvi- ous turns out to be curiosity as the play presents the life of the noble family of the sixteenth century. Throughout this study, the writer wants to analyse what factors which causes and leads into incest. Resides, she will also discuss what the results as well as the consequences of incestuous love especially to the main characters and other character. In this play, the main characters such as Giovanni and Annabella possess flaw which leads them to the tragic condi- tion. Incestl-rous affair, jealousy, love, selfishness, hatred, fear and revenge dominate the play and drawn the characters to their tragic end. The affair of the lovers, the brother and his sister results in the overturn of mar- riage values. Having done the analysis, the writer comes to the conclusion that the flaw of the characters results in the hopelessness as well as helplessness as they fall into the destruction of their lives. The flaw of Giovanni and Annabella dominates their thought and their reasoning that they despise the truth including ignoring religion and moral value as well. The flaw complicates the proper relation, noble characteristics and prevents them from obtaining their happiness.",
