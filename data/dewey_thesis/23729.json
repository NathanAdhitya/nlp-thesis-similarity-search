  "title": "A Study of unsympathetic characters in Anton Chekhov's uncle Vanya and the three sisters",
  "abstract": "There are characteristic similarities in Chekhov's plays. His plays generally are difficult to understand and consist of so many characters that it is difficult to distinguish the major from the minor characters. However, in two of his plays there is another characteristic; Chekhov presents specific characters beside the protagonist. The professor and Natasha are used by Chekhov as unsympathetic characters in order to show the other characters' good qualities. The unsympathetic characters cause unhappiness and destruction to other characters. To find out why they are considered unsympathetic and in what ways they are considered unsympathetic the writer analyzes their attitudes toward other characters, their actions, and other characters' reactions. Through the analysis, the statement that the professor and Natasha are unsympathetic characters is proved.",
