  "title": "Three major reasons that lead doctor faustus into his downfall",
  "abstract": "This thesis primarily deals with Christopher Marlowe?s work Tragical History of Doctor Faustus. In this thesis I want to know the reason why Doctor Faustus dares to summon the devil and make a patch with Lucifer, although Faustus learns theology and comes from educational field. Therefore, this thesis is aimed to analyze the reasons why Faustus summons the devil which lead him into his downfall. I use library and internet researches to get data for the analysis. In order to analyze I use the concept of knowledge as power, ambition and curiosity. After doing the analysis of Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, I find out that there are three major reasons why Faustus summons the devil; to quench Faustus? hunger for knowledge, to ascend himself into higher position in terms of knowledge than other people and to answering Faustus?s curiosity.",
