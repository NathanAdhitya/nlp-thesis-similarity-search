  "abstract": "In verbal communication, sometimes the process does not run smoothly. It happens because the hearer does not know what the speaker expects. Because communication is very important to make a better relationship, the researcher is interested in analyzing speech acts, which play important roles in communication, especially in the illocutions and the perlocution and the factors of communication problems. In the data, the writer chooses \"Anywhere but Here\" because there are many communication problems, especially between Adele as a mother and Ann as a daughter. For the theory, she used Speech Act theory. In collecting the data, the writer transcribed the film then she classified and identified the illocutions and the perlocutions of the utterances and then concluded which area that creates communication problem. In analysis, the researcher found out that the area, which causes communication problems the most, is in Giving (More) Explanation, Asking the Hearer to Do Something, Criticizing and Mocking. As the conclusion, the writer concluded that people could minimize communication problems in their relationship if they understand the expectation of the speaker.",
