  "abstract": "This research observes the figures of speech used in customer dissatisfaction expression. The data were taken from \"Metropolis Watch\" of March 01st- March 31st, 2007 issues of \"Jawa Pos\" newspaper. In \"Metropolis Watch\", the writers of \"Metropolis Watch\" deliver their dissatisfaction by using figures of speech. Therefore, the researcher wanted to reveal the types of figures of speech that are used in customer dissatisfaction expression and the types that are mostly used. The analysis follows Perrine?s and Verdonk?s theories. After analyzing the data, the researcher found out that there were seven types of figures of speech which were used in customer dissatisfaction expression. They were metonymy, personification, synecdoche, metaphor, hyperbole, and simile. The most-often-used figures of speech are metonymy, personification, and synecdoche. The findings show that the most-often-used figures of speech are the ones which are not well-known as figures of speech like metaphor and simile.",
