  "title": "Supplier panel process improvement at PT X using supplier database",
  "abstract": "PT X is currently having a loss opportunity because of a long lead time in the Supplier Panel Process. This was caused by not having a dedicated supplier database for Indirect Material & Services procurement. The root cause of the problem was identified by DMAIC methodology and proposes the implementation of a Supplier Database to replace the current supplier database. The database would contain crucial supplier information such as the supplier's name, industry key, and PIC information, which would reduce the lead time for potential supplier references. By using the proposed improvement, PT X could reduce the lead time of supplier panel process by 15%.",
