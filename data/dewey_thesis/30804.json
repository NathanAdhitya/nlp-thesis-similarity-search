  "abstract": "In Surabaya city of East Java province of Indonesia there is a long-established Hakka social organization called “Hwie Tiauw Ka”, it was established in 1820. This association has been through many difficulties. One of the difficulties is the majority members of Hwie Tiauw Ka association are the elderly. So they really need to prepare the youngsters to preserve this association. In order to do this, they open a Hakka dialect course, hold many activities, and establish a Hakka Youth Division.
