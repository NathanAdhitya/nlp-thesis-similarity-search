  "abstract": "This research observed the use of Indonesian second person terms of address used by the respondents to address their intimate and distant friends when they communicated in social network sites and face-to-face interaction. The main theories used are term of address by Kridalaksana (1985), social distance by Holmes (2001), social network site by Boyd and Ellison (2007), and face-to-face interaction by Begley (2004). The writer conducted this research in quantitative approach. The data were from questionnaires distributed to students who studied in 19 departments of Petra Christian University. The findings showed that there are 7 of 10 categories of Indonesian second person terms of address used by the respondents towards their intimate and distant friends in social network sites and face-to-face interaction. There are also 3 of 10 categories which were not used by the respondents. From the findings, the writer concluded that there is no significant difference on the use of terms of address in social network sites and face-to-face interaction towards the intimate and distant friends.",
