  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of John Loving's search for God and love in Eugene O'Neill's play, Days Without End. Through John's efforts to search for God and love, and his multiple personality, the writer is trying to find out his need of God and love. The writer is curious about the way he searches God and love, and how he finds Him and his love. The writer is also interested in John's attitude towards God and love after he has multiple personality. From the analysis, it can be seen clearly that he fails to get a lasting faith since he is not capable of getting the truth outside the Truth' of God's love. He also tries to express his love and his need of Father Baird's love through all his letters to him, and get Elsa's love and restore her faith in love and marriage through his idea of the ideal marriage. Meanwhile, as his split off personality, Loving, born from John's disappointment, anger and hatred of the loss of God of Love and love, does anything to kill John's faith in Him and His love, and destroy John's love and ones whom he loves. After his realization, he fights against Loving's evil and hateful spirit in order to find Him and love again. Therefore, through his efforts to find Him and love, John's need of God and love is vividly revealed.",
