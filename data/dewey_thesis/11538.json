  "title": "The Factors and the ways the three characters untie the slaves in Harriet Beecher stowe's uncle tom's cabin",
  "abstract": "Harriet Beecher Stowe was very influential in America. She wrote many literary works and the famous one is Uncle Tom?s Cabin. She used slavery as the background of this work. This literary work talks about the struggles of white masters and a mulatto slave to untie the slaves and to get freedom. Therefore, I would like to analyze Uncle Tom?s Cabin because I am curious to know the factors and the ways of three characters in this novel untying the slaves. To analyze, I apply literary approach and use as the tools the theory of characterization and the theory of conflict. Finally, I find that there are outer factors in each character to untie the slaves, such as, the miserable condition of the slaves, the influence from others. And the inner factors are the character traits of the main characters that are kindhearted, full of compassion, trying to apply Christian beliefs, the feeling of loneliness, and a feeling of rebellion against the injustices. The factors are different for each other according to their character traits. Moreover, the factors also influence the ways of each characters to untie the slaves, which is, by education, taking care of the slaves, giving freedom, and running away from the South to the North.",
