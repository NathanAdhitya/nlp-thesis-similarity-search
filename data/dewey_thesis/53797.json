  "title": "The superiority complex of Eleanor Young in crazy rich Asian",
  "abstract": "Crazy Rich Asians is one of the movies that is adapted from literature. In this thesis I am analyzing this movie because of the depiction of a rich person, Eleanor Young, who has an underlying inferiority. However, she shows that she has a superiority over others to cover inferiority. Therefore, in this thesis I am interested in analyzing the superiority complex that was portrayed by Eleanor in the movie and the impact for other characters. In the analysis I use Alfred Adlerâ€™s theory of superiority complex. The findings show that Eleanor's superiority complex is shown through her action and behavior, her speech, and her characteristic traits. Her superiority complex affects other characters, who are Nick and Rachel. As a result, Eleanor does not have a good relationship with Nick and Rachel and she portrays her superiority complex.",
