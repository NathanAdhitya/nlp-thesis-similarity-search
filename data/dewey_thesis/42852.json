  "title": "A brochure for ABC Christian Elementary School",
  "abstract": "ABC Christian Elementary School is located on west of Surabaya, whose target markets are middle upper class people. They do not have brochure for their elementary school and this has created problems during the education fair and open house. Therefore, I make them a brochure in Indonesian and English version as effective and informative promotion tools. I use theory on creating brochures and booklets (Adkins, 1994) and it helps me construct and make this brochure. This brochure contains some newest photos, the school achievement, and also the schoolâ€™s strengths and unique selling points. This way the school can attract more potential customers to join the school.",
