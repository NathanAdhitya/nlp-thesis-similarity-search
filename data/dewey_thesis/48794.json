  "abstract": "Advertisement is one of the ways that various companies are still popularly used in creating brand awareness of the products they want to sell. Advertising can come with multiple media platforms, such as television, posters, youtube, social media, and various other kinds. As any company always faces competition, they want their ad to be the most memorable and engage with their audience's emotions. Each audience has perceived meanings that can be the same or different for each individual. In this study, the writer wanted to find the differences and similarities in men's and women's perceived meanings of the verbal and visual expressions in the Thailand Life Insurance advertisement titled \"Silence of Love.\" The writer would be using the semiotic analysis tools of connotation and denotation. The writer used a qualitative approach because of the need to find data through interviews with women and men respondents. The study found that both respondents focused on the plot when looking at this ad because of the broad image and the message a company wants to convey. However, both respondents had heightened emotional intensity, making them remember that the ad was from a specific Thailand insurance company.",
