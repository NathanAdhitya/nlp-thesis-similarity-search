  "title": "The influence of real earnings management towards company future performance",
  "abstract": "With an attempt to provide a better explanation of the cultural manifestations of social and environmental responsibility in the natural resources industry in Indonesia, the studio examined empirical evidence on the real earnings management (REM) toward company’s future performance while having restructuring, sales growth and earnings benchmark as an intervening variable. In addition, there are firm size, the market value of equity, an indicator of change in COGS, inventory turnover and inventory per total assets as the control variables. Real earnings management is used as a basis for assessing the company’s future performance because it provides an accurate measurement. Thirty-two companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in the consumer goods manufacturer were used as samples, with years of observation from 2013 to 2017. By carrying out structural panel data regression model analysis, it was revealed that future performance positively affected real earnings management while having restructuring, sales growth, and earnings benchmark. This study further discusses previous works by discovering the nature of real earnings management as a strategic decision making to obtain a better result of future performance to overcome financial difficulties.",
