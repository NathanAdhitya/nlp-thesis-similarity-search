  "abstract": "A Study on Irony of Situation in Some of Hardy's Poems as Seen throegh tbe Characters\" is a study concerning Hardy's capability of presenting irony of situation in his poetry. The analysis deals with nine poems and refers to the description of the characters in the poems and their irony of situation. Some characters experience the irony of situation because they are forgotten and neglected by people who are close to them, either their families, relatives or the society ukm they live. While the other characters have to face unavoidable conditions ahiah lead then into an irony of situation. The thesis aiso discusses the significance of death that cones to the characters as the irony of situation. The main point of the discussion is exposing the results of presenting irony of situation in Hardy's poems. Different characters with various experiences are used by Hardy to describe irony of situation in detail. The irony of situation results in understanding of human basic need, in exposing the vanity of manes life, in showing the helplessness of man, and in despising the characters' life.",
