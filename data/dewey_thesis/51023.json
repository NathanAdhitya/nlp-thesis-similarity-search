  "abstract": "The paper described the structural behavior of steel Special Moment Resisting Frames (SMRF) and Stud-Damping Frames (SDF) used in the seismic area. Inelastic and elastic performance and the structure stiffness for SMRF and SDF will be compared to evaluate the objective of this paper. The evaluation is conducted by doing numerical model for the proposed model and doing the time history analysis to obtain the inelastic and elastic response.",
