  "abstract": "Promotion is essential for companies to reach and influence their target market. Due to the increase in competitiveness, product placement (PPL) has become a popular trend for companies to promote their products. Verbal and non-verbal communication is used to deliver the message that companies want to say. In this study, I aim to discover how product placement is conveyed through the verbal and non-verbal communication in some scenes of Korean drama Guardian: Great and Lonely God (Goblin), as well as what meaning of product placement semiotic resources express. I use Multimodal theory to help analyze the data. I use a qualitative approach in doing this research because the methodology itself is applicable for deciphering both verbal and nonverbal data. First, I begin the analysis by collecting the available product placement, then compiling the data into the table. Next, I analyze the data by each mode from the theory. Based on my analysis, I find that companies' messages can be seen through the acting, the facial expression, and the shot of products. In conclusion, product placement is a successful strategy for companies to promote their products.",
