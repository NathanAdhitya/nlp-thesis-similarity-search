  "title": "A Study of Hawkeye as a mythic hero in James Fenimore Cooper's the Last of the Mohicans",
  "abstract": "The main theme that is analyzed in this thesis is the characterization of a white man named Hawkeye who has been described as a mythic hero by D.H Lawrence. The writer views the characterization of Hawkeye as a mythic hero through his characteristics and honorable deeds of him. As a pure white man, he has a deep relationship with an Indian named Chingachgook and he owns the Indian gifts for he is adopted by this tribe. Yet, as a white man he also rejects the white society, therefore he has a double bind which is called \"a man without a cross\". For that reasons, the writer shows why Hawkeye can be called a mythic hero, and later on the writer discusses how this thing is related to the myth of James Fenimore Cooper, since he is a myth maker. In order to accomplish this, the writer uses library research as a method of research by using the novel of James Fenimore Cooper entitled The Last of The Mohicans as the primary data, and also uses literary tools namely characterization, conflict, and the concept of myth. The writer also presents what myths that Cooper has in discussing about Native Americans. Finally, the writer agrees that Hawkeye is proper to be called as a mythic hero, for he reflects the myths of James Fenimore Cooper.",
