  "title": "Discrepancies between the Victorian's and Anthony Trollope's ideas of a gentleman in Anthony Trollope's the warden",
  "abstract": "This thesis is basically a study on the three main male characters in Anthony Trollope's The Warden: Archdeacon Grantly, John Bold, and Septimus Harding. In this thesis, the writer is curious to know about who, among the three main male characters, is called a gentleman according to the Victorians and to Anthony Trollope. For this purpose, the writer needs the Victorians' and Trollope's ideas about a gentleman and also the theory of characterization. The theory of characterization will help the thesis writer in analyzing Archdeacon Grantly's, John Bold's and Septimus Harding's character traits. Later on, their character traits will determine whether they are gentlemen or not according to the Victorians and to Trollope. In the analysis, the thesis writer finds out that Archdeacon Grantly, John Bold and Septimus Harding are gentlemen according to the Victorian society. Nevertheless, the thesis writer also finds out that only one man is considered a gentleman according to Trollope, that is Septimus Harding. Thus, from the analysis, the writer concludes that good mental character traits are more important than good performances in order to be a gentleman.",
