  "abstract": "John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973) is one of the foremost British writers of the twentieth century. His works, especially the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings, have won the heart of English-speaking society. In this thesis, I am discussing the prelude of The Lord of the Rings, namely The Hobbit (1937), that fore shadows the greatness of The Lord of the Rings saga. My topic of discussion is the roles of the main character, Bilbo Baggins, in the quest of restoring the treasure of the Dwarves from the hand of an evil dragon, Smaug. In analysing the roles of Bilbo Baggins, I apply the theories of characterization and conflict. After the analysis is done, I come to the conclusion that Bilbo Bagging has two roles in the quest, as a thief and as a leader. The second role is divided into three sub-roles: Bilbo as Gandalf?s substitute, Bilbo as an investigator/observer, and Bilbo as a negotiator. The application of the theories leads me to the understanding that Bilbo Baggins is a dynamic character who develops through the confrontation and solution of every conflict in the quest.",
