  "title": "The Commonest content transfer problems in the translation of overtones text",
  "abstract": "This research was on translated text of Overtones ,a drama by Alice Gestensberg which was translated by the students of English Department of Petra Christian University. The writer was eager to find out the commonest content transfer problems occurring in the translated text of Overtones from English into Surabaya Variety of Javanese used by Chinese speakers and to check whether the problem causes some effects on the original meaning. The data were taken from the sentences in Overtones text. The writer focused more on the problematic sentences, based on the commonest content transfer problems by Nida & Taber (1982) and other related theory and references. It was found that there are one hundred and ten cases dealing with seven types of commonest content transfer problems. Then, there are fifty two problematic sentences dealing with meaning change. Therefore, to make a good translation without changing the original meaning, the translator should be more aware of the existence of the commonest content transfer problems.",
