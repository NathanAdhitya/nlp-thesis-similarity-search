  "title": "The Word formation processes on slang words produced by homosexsuals in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "Homosexuals show their identity and existence through language. They often produce and create new terms among them. The new terms called slang that they create are not usually comprehended by the society. Slang term was created through a linguistic process, which is called word formation process. Therefore, I am interested in investigating homosexuals? utterance to know what kinds of slang words are produced by them, what types of word formation processes are applied, and which predominant type of word formation processes is used in those homosexuals slang words. In this research I apply the theory of morphology, especially word formation processes. I used Yule?s classification (1996), as the major theory. This theory is supported by gay word formation theory (1999) and Indonesian word formation theory by Chaer (2003). I got the data from three homosexuals in Surabaya considering all slang words occurring in their communication. This study uses a descriptive qualitative approach. The finding shows that from the 69 slang words, which are found in the three homosexuals? utterances, there are nine patterns forming the slang words and the most frequent word formation processes is derivation using especially infix [- in-]. This fact shows that the homosexuals? community likes to use derivation to form their slang words.",
