  "title": "A Study of Eliza's grammatical language development in Shaw's Pygmalion",
  "abstract": "This thesis is the study of Eliza Doolittle's language development in five acts of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion. Margery Morgan in her notes of Pygmalion (1980:61) mentions that Eliza, who comes from a lower class society, becomes a lady through the acquirements of a new way of speaking, new manners, and a new style of behavior. In this study, the writer focuses on the acquirement of Eliza's new way of speaking only. In this case, she tries to analyze the development of Eliza's language through the forms of nonstandard grammatical features and sentence structures. In order to identify the data, the writer needs some thories relating to the study itself. They are the varieties of English, standard and nonstandard English grammar, sentences, and sentence structures. The data classification of the five acts are divided into three sections; complete-incomplete sentences, standard-nonstandard English, and sentence structures. By analyzing the quantitative data, the writer tries to infer the qualitative interpretation as the conclusion of the study. It can be concluded that after Higgins teaches her, Eliza's language development is marked by much less of double negatives, none of the use of aint, and the lesser use of functional improprieties. Besides, her language development can also be seen from her tendency of using more complex sentences than other sentence structures.",
