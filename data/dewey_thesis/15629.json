  "title": "A Study on a hypocrite's failure in reaching his aim in Moliere's Tartuffe",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study on a hypocrite's failure in reaching his aim as seen through the major characters of Moliere's Tartuffe. Tartuffe, as the central character, represents the model of a hypocrite upon religion. In reaching his purpose, Tartuffe deceives his master by pretending to be a true pious person. At first his tricks succeed. Yet, at the end of the story, he appears to be the defeated party. The thesis writer, then, is curious to know what factors make the prentender fail. To assist her analysis, the thesis writer uses literary approach and library research. She begins to study the identity of the central character through his relationship with the other major characters. Later, she will find out the factors which make the efforts of this very hypocrite at getting his ideal come true fail. Finally, the thesis writer can conclude that all the factors come from Tartuffe's own faults. He picks up the wrong ways to reach his destiny and this will result in his failure.",
