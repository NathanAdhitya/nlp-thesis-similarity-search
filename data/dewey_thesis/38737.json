  "title": "Implementation of strategic sourcing to the Kraft Heinz company frozen avocado business",
  "abstract": "The Kraft Heinz Company is the fifth largest food and beverage company in the world. The company is currently facing a supply disruption in their frozen avocado business in Asia Pacific, specifically in Australia and New Zealand. KHC would like to ensure a supply continuity at a competitive price. This objective can be achieved by applying strategic sourcing on the frozen avocado business. Currently, the company has no strategy in purchasing the product. Hence, there is a risk in the supply disruption and price fluctuations from the current supplier. In this dissertation, the author will build a strategic sourcing model. The model is tailored to suit the KHC current situation. The model will be implemented and analyzed in a real business case to match the objective of KHC. The implementation of the case study includes archival research and interviews with potential suppliers. The purpose of the data gathering is to build information and analysis that suits the KHC situation. The result of the dissertation will benefit KHC frozen avocado portfolio by the implementation of the strategy. Recommendations of further research to refine the model developed in this dissertation will be provided at the end of this dissertation. This dissertation also recommends KHC to optimize their supply chain by implementing the strategic sourcing model across their product portfolio.",
