  "title": "Mediating role of affective commitment in the relationship between HRM practices and employee engagement in the context of Surabaya's millennial workforce in the manufacturing sector",
  "abstract": "The manufacturing sector is believed to be the sector that will drive Indonesia's economic growth. However, millennial employees, which are the least engaged employees, are beginning to dominate this sector. Human Resource Management (HRM) practices such as career advancement, performance feedback, job security, training and development, rewards and recognition, and employee participation are said to be the significant predictors of employee engagement. Also, the relationship between HRM practices and employee engagement is mediated by affective commitment. This research aims to identify the influence of Surabaya's millennial workforce's HRM practices in the manufacturing sector to their attention. This research also sought to find out whether or not the mediation effect of affective commitment exists. An online questionnaire was distributed to 120 qualified respondents. The data gathered has passed the validity, reliability, and classical assumption tests. Through using multiple regression analysis and Sobel test, this research proved that performance feedback, job security, training and development, and rewards and recognition are individually significant to employee engagement of Surabaya's millennial workforce working in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, it turns out that affective commitment partially mediates the relationship between training and development and employee engagement.",
