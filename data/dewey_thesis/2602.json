  "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the Dominant?s ideology and how the Dominant maintain the hegemony over the Marginal. In Harry Potter series, the society of magical world is split into two groups, the Dominant and the Marginal. The Dominant want to lead the society by maintaining the hegemony over the Marginal. Therefore, I want to find out what is the Dominant?s ideology and to analyze the Dominant?s hegemony over the Marginal. As I use cultural approach, I use the theories of ideology and hegemony. In my analysis, I use the Harry Potter?s society point of view to observe the Dominant?s hegemony over the Marginal and how the Marginal respond to the hegemony. I analyze the Dominant ideology which consist of purity, social and political status, honor and wealth. I will also analyze how they maintain the hegemony over the Marginal, how they apply their ideologies in the society. Last but not least, I also want to find out what the Marginal responses about the hegemony. As a conclusion, the Marginal can get out of the Dominant?s oppressions and finally get an acknowledgement from the society.",
