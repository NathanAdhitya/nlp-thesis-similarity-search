  "title": "The brand essence of L’Occitane through verbal and visual expressions in its advertisement videos",
  "abstract": "This thesis mainly deals with Semiotics field which focuses on the use of denotation and connotation in order to reveal the brand essence which is shaped by the two advertisement videos of A #TrueStory: The True Story of L’Occitane and 40 Years of True Stories: The Beginning through the verbal and visual expressions. First of all, the writer starts her analysis by finding out the keyword(s) in both of the advertisement videos. Then, she finds the hidden messages in the verbal expressions in the advertisement videos. Furthermore, by using denotation and connotation theory, the writer later explains the relation of each of the verbal expressions. Then, the writer proceeds to capture the visual expressions from both of the advertisement videos which support the verbal expressions. In revealing the hidden meaning, the writer uses denotation in order to find the literal meaning, then she uses the connotation in order to reveal the second layer. She uses qualitative content analysis method in interpreting and describing the analysis. Based on her analysis, she finds that the brand essence of L’Occitane is “going back to nature”. The brand essence is supported by three hidden messages that each of the hidden message conceives several connotative layers which connect to the brand essence.",
