The writer used Larson’s (1984) kinds of translation (literal and idiomatic translation). The writer was interested in analyzing the swear words, especially the classification whether it is being translated match to the original meaning or not, for example, “anjing” becomes “dog”, “bajingan” becomes “bastard” or being translated using different swear words in the English subtitle of the movie. The writer found that there are so many dialogues translated using swear words on the subtitle of the movie while the dialogue itself does not have any swear words. The rest of other swear words are being translated match with its original meaning, and there are also different translation.",
