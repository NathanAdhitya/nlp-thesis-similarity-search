  "abstract": "This thesis concerns with the study of selfrealization of the main character in Arthur Miller's After the Fall. The discussion is also to understand what the main character's problems are and how he comes to his self-realization. Quentin has failed in his two marriages. These failures affect his sense of being. He feels lonely and empty. It is until he meets Holga, a woman he really wants to marry that Quentin, the main character, looks back to his past. Only after he learns and tries to examine what he has done in the past, he is able to understand himself. After reaching his selfrealization, Quentin becomes courageous to face his life. He can accept himself and others both as a human being and as a unique person. In short, Quentin, the main character is successful in reaching self-realization.",
