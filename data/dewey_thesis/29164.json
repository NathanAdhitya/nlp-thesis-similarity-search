  "abstract": "The main character in this comic, Light Yagami, a brilliant student, discovers the Death Note and he uses it to create a utopia through banishing the criminals. In this thesis I want to analyze what are Light’s reasons to create a world without criminals. I also want to know what are his efforts to reach the ideal world and results of his efforts. The main purpose of this study is to discuss Light’s reasons, efforts, and the results of his efforts creating a utopian world. In this study, I find out that the boundary between utopia and dystopia is getting blurrier. In an intention to create a better world, violence which is against utopian values is used. To answer the statement of the problem, I use the concept of utopia from Thomas More and Jon Will. Those concepts are suitable to discover that Light’s intention to create a better world turns to be dystopic. Light’s efforts to create a utopian society lead to a dystopian one for himself and the others. In the study, I have found out that Light’s intention can bring the world towards dystopia. Furthermore, I find that Death Note manga is criticism to the impossibility to create a utopian society.",
