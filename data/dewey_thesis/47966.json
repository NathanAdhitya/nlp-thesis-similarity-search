  "title": "Designing “Pitchy:Sales” web application to increase sales process effectiveness based on usability",
  "abstract": "Salespeople experience trouble sharing their sales information during the sales process, such as extensive proposal sharing and directly designed proposals. Pitchy: Sales is a tool in the form of a web application to allow salespeople from Small Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) to create proposals, edit them dynamically, and share them. The project's goal is to do research, design, prototype, and test the prototype of the web application, which could help improve the efficiency of the sales process. The paper described the design process of the making of Pitchy: Sales. Interview and literature research was conducted to understand the target user. A competitor analysis was performed to differentiate. Guidelines of design usability and design credibility were implemented during the designing process. Lastly, the prototype was tested to the target user to check its usability. The final prototype of Pitchy: Sales is ready to be pushed further and developed as a new web application.",
