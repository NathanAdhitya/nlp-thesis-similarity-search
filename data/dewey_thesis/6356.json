The findings show that the female boarders mostly used the function of `Seeking Information? (32.4%). The second function, which occurred, was `Affirmation or negation? (20.6%). The third function is `Suggestion, invitation, or advice? (14.7%). The fourth function is `Offering? (11.8%). The fifth function is `Mocking? (5.9%). The sixth function is `Requesting? (5.9%). While the function of `Having a Negative Orientation?, `A Strong Negative Orientation?, and `Impatience or annoyance? (2.9%) occurred the three least. From the percentages, it could be noticed that the female boarders mostly used the function of seeking information; it is because women are always curious about anything that happen around them.",
