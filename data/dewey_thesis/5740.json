  "title": "The Moral development of Jean Valjean as seen in Victor Hugo's les miserables",
  "abstract": "My paper talks about moral development as the topic. Through that, I ask about a will of a man want find or make a journey of developing morality. Morality cannot come from itself; there are many steps ahead to follow in order to acquire it, which is the purpose of the study for my paper. For the methodology I use psychological approach via Kohlberg?s stages of morality theory to make my paper well equipped. In the end, morality is something that corresponds with mankind?s self development and influence by the society point of view. From the findings I have collect, morality is abstract, it means that we cannot see it as a thing but we able to see it as an act, way of think, and the decision we make, that will answer what morality we have, as the good or evil.",
