  "abstract": "This thesis aims to respond the inquiries of the thesis writer on why and how a weak and exhausted human being, Jesus, possesses the potential to resist a deleterious spirit, Satan, who successively tempts Jesus. it is expected that the readers of this thesis will appreciate and comprehend more the amazing serenity of Jesus in Paradise Regained as in the end of the poem, it subdues evilness. Moreover, consummating this thesis, the thesis writer applies theory of characterization as well as the theory of reader's point of view which enable her to interpret the poem as freely as possible. Thus, ultimately from the entire thesis, it is crystalline that calmness, wisdom, faith and righteousness-the means to resist evilness performed by Jesus-are potential to contend evilness.",
