  "abstract": "This research was on the translation of dubbed utterances in ?Amongst Friends? on Beskop Suroboyoan-JTv. The writer was eager to find out the kinds of translation that occurred in translated text of ?Amongst Friends? from English into East Javanese-Suroboyoan dialect and the quality of its translation overall. She used quantitative and qualitative approach. The data were taken from the utterances in ?Amongst Friends? master film. The writer focused more on the original and dubbed utterances, based on the meaning-based translation theory by Larson (1984), the East Javanese-Suroboyoan dialect by Adipitoyo (1992) and certain related references. It was found that the translations occurred in the dubbed utterances were four kinds out of the seven kinds as stated by Larson (1984). The idiomatic translation was the most dominant. However, the untranslated text influences the quality of its translation overall. Therefore, the translation of this film has quite good quality. This quality implies that the translator had many purposes to make the translation sounds more natural and to popularize the old East Javanese-Suroboyoan dialect to the television audiences.",
