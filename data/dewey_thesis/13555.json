The thesis writer is curious to know how the main character's conflicts reveal his humanity. Furthermore, the thesis writer wants to know whether his humanity is only for those he loves or to his enemies.

He even can win over the bad circumstances and his humanity remains unshaken. This condition shows that througli the character of Jim Wormold, the humanity is revealed.",
