  "title": "Behind the canvas: a novel exploring the effects of childhood verbal abuse on adolescents’ behavioral development",
  "abstract": "The number of child abuse has been rising over the past several years. This increase, along with the fact that some people are still rationalizing its conduct, might root from the lack of awareness over the long-lasting effects of abuse, particularly verbal abuse. Some people still consider what classifies verbal abuse as tough love while ignoring its harmful effects. In concern to this reality, this thesis explores the issues of childhood verbal abuse on the victims’ behavioral development by showing the kinds, the effects, and the solutions to childhood verbal abuse while adhering to Ronald Rohner’s Parental Acceptance-Rejection Theory and John Bowlby’s Attachment Theory. I will be exploring this issue by creating a bildungsroman novel to show how childhood verbal abuse, covert or overt, can make the protagonist feel insecure, emotionally unstable, aloof, and untrusting. The reasons for these behaviors come from the protagonist’s attachment to his abusive mother’s opinion about him, his yearning and fear of love, and his bleak outlook toward life. Nevertheless, he ends up overcoming it by having another supportive parental figure and undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy.",
