  "title": "The impact of macroeconomic factors on IDX composite return: evidence from Indonesia market",
  "abstract": "The goal of this study is to determine the link between the IDX composite return and the independent variable, macroeconomic variables (such as inflation, interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and foreign exchange reserves). This study focuses on the IDX composite return as a whole since it represents the whole performance of all shares listed on the Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI), and it may also be used as a measure of Indonesia's economic development. The studies are carried out using time-series analysis and the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model (GARCH) model, both of which are implemented using the Gnu Regression, Econometrics, and Time-series Library (GRETL) program. Inflation and interest rates do not have a strong connection with IDX composite return, according to the findings of this study. The foreign exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves, on the other hand, show a strong correlation with the IDX composite return. Foreign exchange rates have a negative significant relationship with IDX composite return, but foreign exchange reserves have a positive significant relationship.",
