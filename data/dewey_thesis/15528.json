  "abstract": "This study is about Henrik Ibsen?s The Lady from the Sea. In this study, the writer is going to discuss Ellida Wangel?s coping with the land life. The writer considers this topic significant since she discovers that Ellida?s homeland has left its mark so deeply in her mind, that she finds it difficult to acclimatize herself to her new environment. Through this study, the writer is challenged to analyze Ellida?s coping with the land life to find out why Ellida is unable to cope with her life on the land as well as how finally she succeeds in coping with the land life. By applying literary theories on characterization, conflict, and setting, the writer discovers that Ellida is unable to cope with her life on the land because she is intensely attached to the sea. Besides that, her inharmonious relationships with her husband and stepdaughters as well as the people in the town also take part in creating her inability to cope with the land life. Furthermore, the writer also learns that in order to survive on the land, Ellida attempts to escape from her reality through her fantasy. By studying Ellida?s coping with the land life, the writer concludes that it is hard to acclimatize oneself to a new environment, and yet feeling of being needed and loved may assist one to acclimatize oneself to the new environment.",
