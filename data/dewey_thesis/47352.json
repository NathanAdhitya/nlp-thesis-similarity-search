  "title": "Properties evaluation of bio composite made from sugar palm fiber reinforced polylactic acid",
  "abstract": "Sugar palm fiber (SPF) reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) matrix composites were prepared using a twin-screw extruder and injection molding. Two types of samples were studied, one using Maleated PLA (MAPLA) and one without MAPLA. The composition was prepared in the range of 0 to 30 wt.% sugar palm fiber with 5wt.% step. The mechanical properties (tensile and impact tests) and microstructure (SEM micrograph) were evaluated. The results show that adding MAPLA improves the bonding between the fiber and matrix, thus increasing the tensile strength up to 7.5%. The tensile properties studied have yet to reveal the optimum value. However, the tensile strength produced (52.62 to 56.82 MPa) shows a promising result for an application as a carâ€™s interior part, such as a parcel tray. This high tensile strength results in low impact resistance (1.62 to 2.36 kJ/m2), meanwhile the impact strength for composites without MAPLA is around 10% higher, particularly in higher SPF content. The SEM evaluation confirmed a better bonding between SPF and the matrix in samples with MAPLA samples, and fiber pull-out dominates in the composite without MAPLA.",
