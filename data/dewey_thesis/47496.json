  "title": "This is my country(?): exploring denial in relation to the negative aspects of nationalism in Indonesia",
  "abstract": "This creative work follows the journey of a soldier who, in his attempt to find his long-lost brother, is confronted with terrible truths about the country he’s serving. It explores the theme of blind conviction and the struggle of acknowledging undesired realities that many would rather ignore or forget about. Narrative-wise, this historical fiction novel is set in 1970’s Indonesia, where the iron-clad rule of the New Order regime held sway, and many atrocities were overlooked out of national devotion. In essence, the story highlights the psychological effects of wide-reaching ideologies, as well as their connection through the use of Stanley Cohen’s theory of denial and George Orwell’s criticism of nationalism, respectively. Through these theories, I find that the Indonesian people are plagued with the denial of nationalism’s negative aspects and are willing to neglect its consequences, including the deaths of many so-called “enemies of the state.”",
