  "abstract": "Studying characters in a drama is important, because by studying the characters we can learn more about people. From a character study we can obtain some knowledges about human nature. Therefore, in this thesis the writer-discusses about Brutus' character traits in Julius Cesar Brutus has a noble motivation in committing assassination and he is supported by several senators and aristocratic families yet he fails to defend Rome as a republic. The writer is curious to know the reasons that cause Brutus to fail in his struggle. By discussing Brutus'positive and negative' character traits through his thought, speech, action and relationship with other characters, the wriver finds the reasons of Brutus' failure. Brutus has positive character traits which are honourable and trustworthy. Because of those traits, he is easily manipulated by others and he develops an excessive confidence in himself. Unconscious of his own weaknesses, he makes several total decisions that cause his failure. It can be concluded that the reasons Brutus has failed in defending Rome as a republic is because of his character traits.",
