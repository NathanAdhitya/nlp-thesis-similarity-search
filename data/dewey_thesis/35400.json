Salim Tours and Travels is located on Panglima Sudirman 72-1, Surabaya, which is at the center of Surabaya. Salim Tours and Travel Agency was established on 2nd February, 2002 in Surabaya. Because of Tour and Travel have a good prospect in the future, Salim Tours need a way to promote their product and services, especially the tours because the tour is a good product to sell. By looking at this condition, I decided to make a website which has 6 pages that consist of “Home”, “Ticket and Hotel reservation”, “ Travel Document”, “Tour”, “Gallery”, and “Contact us”, where every page provides all of the information about the services and the products of Salim International Tours and Travel. By having this information, this website will able to help Salim Tours and Travel compete with other competitors, get an opportunity to increase the sale and get more customers.",
