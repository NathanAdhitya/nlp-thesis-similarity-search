  "abstract": "This project brings up an issue about beauty concept in a form of children’s story book. The children’s story book is in a fantasy adventure genre where the target readers, children at the ages of 12 to 15, can learn about this issue in a fun and exciting way. The story shows some beauty concepts in the world through a fantastical adventure that the main character experiences in four countries. The main character of this story is a beautiful little girl who always wants to be the most beautiful girl wherever she is. The main character thinks that beauty will help her to gain attention from everybody, and she loves to be the center of attention. The beauty concept obsesses her very much because of the beauty hegemony that appears in her society. Then through the magical journey in the four countries, the main character learns that beauty is not something as simple as the way she knows about it before. The main character experiences the false consciousness of beauty concepts from the society conditioning. In the end of the story, the main character then realizes that inner beauty is far more important than physical beauty.",
