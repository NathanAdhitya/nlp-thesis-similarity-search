  "title": "Ivanka Trump's rhetorics in defense of Donald Trump's political standing",
  "abstract": "This study was to find out about the rhetorical appeals and the prominent forms of persuasions in Ivanka Trump's political speech. The source of the data of this study are texts related to Ivanka Trump’s 2020 RNC speech. The data of this study are the verbal speech, gestures, vocal delivery, and facial expression as well as words, phrases, and sentences. In this study, the writer used a qualitative content analysis approach. The theories applied consist of rhetorical appeals and persuasion theory as main theory, supported by the theories of rhetorical styles, rhetorical delivery, and context. The findings reveal that Ivanka used all forms of rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, logos) in the selected speech. In addition, 20 forms of prominent persuasions were present in her speech. The conclusions of this study suggest that Ivanka’s persuasions were used to present and defend Donald Trump’s political standing, took advantage of one’s privileged status to gain credibility, kept the emotional atmosphere as positive/pleasant as possible, and proposes favorable portrayals using logic for more compelling arguments. Also, it suggests that forms of persuasion which implicitly delivers campaign’s message whilst bringing favorable portrayals can successfully affect the prospective voters’ attitude and action.",
