  "abstract": "This thesis discusses about the failure of Eustacia to reach her ambitions of Thomas Hardy's The Return of the Native. The writer feels challenged to analyze the ambitions of Eustacia, the cause as well as the result of her failure in gaining the ambitions. In addition, the writer tries to show whether Eustacia's death is fated or not To analyze and support the analysis, the writer uses the theory of literature, namely setting and characterization. By using the theory of setting, the writer knows that the ambitions of Eustacia are influenced by the natural feature in Egdon Heath, the family background, and the life of people in Egdon Heath. Meanwhile, the theory of characterization helps the writer to analyze the cause as well as the result of Eustacia's failure. And the thesis writer finds out that Eustacia is a dreamer, and an ambitious, frustrated and faithless woman. Those are her flaws in character and they are the cause as well as the result of Eustacia's failure to gain her ambitions. Finally, the writer is able to answer that the death of Eustacia is not only fated by God but it is also caused by some flaws in her character.",
