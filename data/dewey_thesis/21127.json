  "abstract": "The White Devil Webster's very famous play is a means in carrying his intention to criticize the evil of some people in achieving their ambitions.To achieve his purpose,he titles his characters with the term \"white devils This term is used to potray hypocretc or evil characters who usually disguise their appearance attractively.Webster tries to criticize the practice of hypocrisy by some people that only leads them to ruin themselves or cause their self destruction.This term is really interesting to discuss since it uses the word \"white \"specifically to depict the \"devils \"(evil characters). Besides,in Elizabethan proverb,it is believed as something worse than the black one.Webster utilizes the two characters of the play,Vittoria Corombona and Flamineo to represent the wrong things he attack as well as describe the characteristics of the \"white devil Vittoria and Flamineo disguise their appearances as innocent persons,in fact they commit some evil deeds such as flatering,betraying and even killing other people.These all are driven by their excessive,ambitions to be rich.Instead of getting wealth,they finally find their death miserably.",
