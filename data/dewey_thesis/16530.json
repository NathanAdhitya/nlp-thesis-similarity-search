  "title": "The Performance evaluation of PT Unibindo Pertiwi's sales representatives in selling its product",
  "abstract": "In this paper, the writers survey PT Unibindo Pertiwi Surabaya's sales performance evaluation in selling its products. We chose this topic because the salespersons could not achieve the sales target after one year of marketing in Surabaya. The writers intend to find out whether the sales force has done, at least, the standard strategies to sell a product according to the related theory of personal selling skill. The writers collect the data according to the theory and count the percentage by distributing questionnaires. This paper indicates that the salespersons have already practised the fundamental strategies. After interviews with the related persons, the writers found out that several internal and external factors affect sales. Finally, the writers would like to give conclusions and recommendations for the company. Hopefully, the company can use this paper to determine the following policy and sales target.",
