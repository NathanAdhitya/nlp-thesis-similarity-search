  "title": "A Study of Naomi Nakane's identity crisis in Joy Kogawa's obasan",
  "abstract": "Identity crisis can happen to all people that do not have deep knowledge about their own identity especially in the society. Identity crisis that I want to discuss is based from the novel Obasan by Joy Kogawa. I want to know how Naomi as the main character experiences the identity crisis and how she overcomes it. My purpose in this study is to find out the ways Naomi experiences identity crisis and the ways she overcomes it. This study uses library research to find sources about identity crisis. I also use literary approach to get deeper analysis in the study. I use literary tools such as conflict and characterization. I also use concept of identity as the supporting theory to show Naomi?s ways in overcoming her identity crisis. Naomi experiences identity crisis because of the treatment from the Canadian toward her. The derogatory address and the isolation make Naomi experience identity crisis and denying her identity as Canadian. She can overcome her identity crisis when she realizes her own identity from a Canadian man and forgiving the society that make her hurt. Finally, identity is very important in life. From the study of the identity crisis, I can know that by knowing my identity in the society, I can function well in my society.",
