  "title": "An annotated translation of a book entitled experiencing God in the ordinary",
  "abstract": "An annotated translation is based on notes and observations which the translator writes down while in the process of translation, concentrating mainly on problematic passages or, depending on the approach, passages with interesting features relating to the topic of the project. In this project, I translated a book entitled Experiencing God in The Ordinary from English as the Source Language to Bahasa Indonesia as the Target language using the annotated translation method. The book is 215 pages excluding the Preface and About the Author pages. Based on the translation result, I classified and explained the difficulties encountered by using Newmark Four Levels in Translation: the textual, the referential, the cohesive, and the naturalness (Newmark, 1988).",
