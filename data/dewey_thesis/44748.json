  "abstract": "Vasa Hotel Surabaya is a five-star hotel in West Surabaya located in HR. Muhammad Street no. 31, Surabaya. Vasa Hotel Surabaya has three kinds of restaurants, 209 dinings, Xiang Fu Hai, and Chamas Churrascaria. Xiang Fu Hai is a Chinese restaurant which has started its business since 2017. However, there is a problem in the number of Xiang Fu Haiâ€™s customer. Even though Xiang Fu Hai has been established for two years, Xiang Fu Hai has a low number of customers coming on weekdays. However, on weekends, Saturday and Sunday, this Chinese restaurant is always full of customers. Xiang Fu Hai cannot depend on the existing customers and has to find a new target market which is university students. Marketing research for a new target market is needed to know the factors that can attract them to come to Xiang Fu Hai. The marketing research helps Xiang Fu Hai to create offers which match with the university students needs and demand, and the offers can run effectively and successfully. By having marketing research, the company has the base to make the right offers, so they will not waste much time and money for trials and errors.",
