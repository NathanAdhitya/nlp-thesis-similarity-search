  "abstract": "This thesis deals mainly with the thesis writer's assumption that the nature of the relationship between son and mother in John Updike's Of the Farm is similar with Freud's theory of . According to Freud the definition of Oedipus Complex is a libidinal feeling that develops in a male child for the parent of the opposite sex, his mother (Jastrow 1932:199). Besides that the thesis writer is curious to find the reason of Joey's jealousy toward his mother's farm, since in Oedipus Complex case, the son usually feels jealous to his father, whom he considers as his rival. Thus, through her analysis of Joey's relationship with his mother, his wives and the farm, the thesis writer finds out the nature of the relationship between son and mother in Ofthe Farm fits with some of Freud's theory of Oedipus Complex. All the criteria of the theory of Oedipus Complex that are: possessiveness, attachment, erotic desire and jealousy; are clearly seen in the whole analysis in chapter three. And the thesis writer also finds out that the reason of Joey's jealousy toward the farm is because it is not his father who is his mother's lover, but the farm. It does not matter, because the context is the same. Joey is jealous with the farm, since it is his rival.",
