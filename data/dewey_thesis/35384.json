  "abstract": "The first education themed Indonesian movie during Indonesian film industry history is exposed in Ari Sihasale’s debut, Denias, Senandung di Atas Awan. This film presents a struggle of a boy, Denias, in pursuing his dream to achieve a better education. The boy goes through several impossible procesess and then he can reach his dream which is the opportunity to be a student. Also, through this movie, Denias is recognized as a hero. Thus, I am interested to analyze how Denias’ inner jouner is. In order to help my pursuit in answering my statement of the problem, I decided to use Christopher Vogler’s theory which is the Character Arc. In order to reveal Denias’ inner journey, I will use the first act of character arc and its five stages to reveal Denias’departure to find education. Furthermore, I will apply the second act and its four stages to reveal Denias’ inner process to get education. In the end, I will apply the third act and its stages to reveal how Denias’perseverance to maintain his goal in pursuing his education. Thus, in the end of this study, I can conclude that a common boy can also be recognized as a hero because he has a great effort. This effort can be seen through his (Denias’) inner journey that leads him to be an educated person.",
