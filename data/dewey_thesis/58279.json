  "title": "Welcoming the future: cultural capital and children’s online learning in Sidoarjo, Indonesia",
  "abstract": "This qualitative study examines the cultural capital of parents, administrators, and teachers in online learning, drawing from Bourdieu’s theory. Through observations and interviews, the research explores an English course in Sidoarjo, Indonesia involving the stakeholders. The study uncovers cultural capital elements such as communication styles, white lies, blaming others, and unfulfilled commitments, manifesting unconsciously. It also reveals the fundamental principles of Javanese social life: conflict avoidance, rukun (social harmony), and respect, supported by wedi, isin, and sungkan values. The findings show that cultural capital influences teachers’ behaviour in involving parents in students’ learning. However, the stakeholders’ habitus, shaped by cultural capital, has a greater impact on student’s learning experiences. Empathy is crucial for understanding the diverse backgrounds, cultures, and experiences of students, teachers, and parents.",
