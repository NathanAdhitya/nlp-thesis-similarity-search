  "abstract": "This dissertation is written as the final part of the writers? traineeship in Ni Hao Restaurant Groningen. It is going to discuss about managing employee diversity in a multi cultural workplace which is based on the writer?s observation at Ni Hao Restaurant Groningen, The Netherlands. The writers think that it is important to put the matter into the surface because mostly managers do not see this matter as a big problem that can bring negative impact to the teamwork. Due to the time limitation, the observation was done only from service area which the writers are placed during their traineeship. Qualitative research has been conducted by doing observation, interviewing managers, collecting supporting literature, and in the end drawing conclusion and giving recommendations. By doing the methodology mentioned above, we will be able to understand more about the situation from manager?s view and come with the required solution in order to make a better relation among employees.",
