  "abstract": "A research has been carried out in Concrete and Construction Laboratory of Petra Christian University in Surabaya. The purpose of this research is to obtain information about the effect of paving stone type (fly ash/cement ratio) and curing period on paving stone strength using two Factorial Design Analysis. From the research, paving block type 0 (0% fly ash and 100% cement) gives the highest mean strength, 377.93 kg/cm 2 after 90 days of curing. The lowest mean strength, 155.05 kg/cm 2 given by paving block type 3 (30% fly ash and 70% cement), after 28 days of curing. Two factor design analysis gives result that paving stone type gives greater effect to compressive strength than curing period and there is no significant interaction between paving stone type and curing period.",
