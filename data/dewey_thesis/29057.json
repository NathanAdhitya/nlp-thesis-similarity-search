  "title": "The Persuasive strategies used by the higher-ranked and the lower-ranked salespeople of KK multi level marketing in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "This study deals with persuasion in salesmanship. I attempt to see the use of persuasion done by the salespeople in a famous multi-level marketing, KK. The salespeople are divided into higher ranked and lower ranked salespeople. The distinction is based on the achievement they get. The theory of persuasive strategy used here is from Bender (1980). Meanwhile, another theory about Steps of Selling Process supported the first theory above. By using these theories, I use role-play situation to get the data. There are 20 salespeople as the respondent. They are given a situation to help them to do the role-play. From the research, I found that the higher-ranked salespeople use the strategies in the higher frequencies compared to the lower-ranked salespeople. They also produce more various strategies. Moreover, the higher-ranked salespeople are more direct compared to the lower salespeople.",
