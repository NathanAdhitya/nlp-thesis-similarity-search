  "title": "The Hypermasculine and ubersexual men in the harlequin novels of the 1980s and 2000s",
  "abstract": "Harlequin novels are so popular that Harlequin romance emerges as a genre. Moreover, these novels have a bigger role in reflecting the men and women in the society into the heroes and heroines. While many people have studied about the heroines, there are scarcely any studies or works on the heroes. I want to find out about the heroes. By analyzing using the Male Sex Role in the 1980s and themes of masculinity in the 2000s, I found that there are four types of ideal men in the 1980s Harlequin novels whose characteristics originated from that of the ideal men’s in the society at that time, the Hypermasculine men with extreme masculinity and avoidance of any feminine sides. I also found there are three types of ideal men in the 2000s Harlequin novels whose characteristics are in accordance with the Ubersexual men, the ideal men in the society in 2000s who have positive characteristics of traditional manliness with some characteristics regarded as feminine. The reason behind these changes in the heroes is because the heroines changes in time and the changing of the characteristics pushes for the changes in the heroes also. This shows that what the readers want changes, and as a publisher, Harlequin’s goal is for the highest selling rate and thus, they adjust with what the market demand.",
