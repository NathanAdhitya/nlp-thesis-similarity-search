  "abstract": "This thesis concerns on the study of parody as a medium of satire in Lewis Carroll?s Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Trough the Looking Glass . These books actually are not merely children literature because Carroll used them as a mask to conceal his purpose in criticizing the moral attitudes of the Victoriane at that time. Since a parody alwaya ridicules something, the writer is curious to know what objects Carroll wants to ridicule. By comparing the parodies and the works being parodied, the writer tries to find the objects. Then the writer will analyze the ridicu-. lous objects in order to find the target of satire. By this analysis, the writer expects the readers will get better conceptions about the Victorian moral attitude, that is hypocrisy",
