  "title": "An Analysis of William Mor's immorality based on his character and conflicts in Murdoch's the sandcastle",
  "abstract": "This thesis deals with William Mor's morals as revealed in his novel, \"The Sandcastle\". The study of morality is very interesting because it pictures the real life of human beings as God's creation who have the freedom to make their own decision. But sometimes they break God's law and become immoral persons. This thesis is concerned with the question of William Mor's morality in solving his marriage problem. The writer is challenged to analyze the novel to find out William Mor's morals. By using characterization and conflict, and also finding out how Mor solves his problems, the writer concludes that Mor is an immoral person. She bases her conclusion on the following: William Mor's dishonesty, neglect of parental responsibility, infidelity, and hypocrisy. The thesis writer further concludes that happiness cannot be reached if a person behaves immorally. He or she will be sorrowful because of his or her mistakes.",
