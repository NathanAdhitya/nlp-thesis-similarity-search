  "title": "LG G5 advertisement focused on visual and verbal image",
  "abstract": "Before this research, I want to analyze the LG G5 advertisement because LG G5 is not similar to other companies' mobile phones. At the moment, LG G5 was released newly, LG G5 has special functions, unique designs, and several additional devices and modular types. Therefore, LG G5 advertisement is worth researching. This research attempts to discover the perceived meaning in G5's advertisement for LG. At the elaborations of the research problem, two research questions arise as follows (1) how meaning is in the advertisement created through verbal expression (2) how meaning is in the advertisement-supported by visual expression. The theories are semiotics, signification, denotation, and connotation. Methods are descriptive qualitative. The findings are implying that LG G5 is a symbol of happiness, enjoyment, and an icon of fancy and modern by the verbal expression. Also, it shows LG G5's brand image as LG is a technology innovation company, as well as a company that supports happiness in people's lives through verbal and non-verbal expression.",
