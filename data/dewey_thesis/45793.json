  "title": "Capital structure and firm performance: empirical evidence from property, real estate, and building construction firms listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange",
  "abstract": "As the trend of price and the cost of funding in Indonesia property, real estate and building construction industry rise, this research intended to examine the impact of the capital structure toward firm performance in Indonesia property, real estate and building construction industry. This research used fixed effect panel regression model in analyzing sample firms to establish the relationship between capital structure and firm performance after controlling firm-specific factors such as firm size, firm age, firm tangibility and firm growth opportunity. Empirical results reported that leverage has a negative impact toward firm profitability of Indonesia associated firms which is in line with pecking order theory. The findings of the paper suggested that firms in the related industry should evaluate their capital structure as leverage hurts firm performance.",
