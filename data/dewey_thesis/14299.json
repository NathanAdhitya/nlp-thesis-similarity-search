  "title": "Study in similarity of grammatical errors of children with different mother tongues in learning english as a second language",
  "abstract": "This study is about the similarity of grammatical errors between children with different nationalities and mother tongues, Korean, Mandarin, Indonesian, and English. The focus is on the grammatical errors of the children in the same age. The thesis writer analyzes the grammatical errors of the children and tries to find out the similarities between them even though they have different nationalities and different mother tongues. The writer does this study by recording the sentences produced by the children in an English-speaking environment and the data used in this research is the sentences with grammatical errors. The sentences are categorized based on the characteristic of the errors. The result of this study reveals that some of the grammatical errors, spotted by the writer, are similar even thought not every error is identical. From the kind of errors and their similarities, the writer concludes that children with different nationalities and mother tongues, Korean, Mandarin, Indonesian, and English, can create similar errors when they are acquiring English as their second language.",
