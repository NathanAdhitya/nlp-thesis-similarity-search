  "title": "Smile, Sara! and other stories: Children’s picture books exploring emotional regulation",
  "abstract": "Emotional regulation process has already happened since infancy as humans learn to manage emotions with different strategies. As childhood is one of the crucial phases to learn emotional regulation, this creative thesis explores emotional regulation strategies performed by children in five children’s picture book stories. My theoretical framework is derived from Emotional Regulation Theory by James Gross. I explore how using a response modulation strategy such as expressive suppression has negative consequences rather than strategies that are antecedent-focused for children. In other words, performing antecedent-focused strategies such as situation modification shows better effects. As a result of negative emotions they try to suppress when performing expressive suppression strategy, each child character in the stories experiences unpleasant effects such as stress, pessimism, and discomfort with the people around them. The characters then switch to a situation modification strategy as seen through the characters’ dialogue or actions by modifying aspects of their initial situation that trigger their negative emotions. All these lead to better consequences of emotional regulation such as experiencing a happier mood and lower levels of negative mood.",
