  "title": "A Study of male's oppression in Catherine Lim's The Woman's Book of Superlatives",
  "abstract": "Patriarchy is one of the ideologies that exists in the society as men?s dominance over women. Men are considered to be strong, superior, and aggressive creations and they tend to consider women as weak, inferior, and passive creations. Catherine Lim recorded the real incident of the men's superiority toward women in her collection of short stories The Woman's Book of Superlatives. In this thesis, I want to reveal that the major male characters oppress the major female characters in every aspect of their lives and that the sufferings of the female characters affect their psychological and physical condition. The male's oppression can happen in the domestic domain, such as in the family and in the personal relationship and in the public domain, for instance, in the office. Even though the female characters resist the oppression, all of them still have to suffer. The theory of patriarchy, and the two key concepts; oppression and suffering are used to help in analyzing this thesis. I can conclude that the patriarchal ideology is used to justify men's oppression and it leads the female characters to the psychological and physical sufferings.",
