  "title": "Cracks in the self: A poetry collection exploring narcissism and its coping mechanism in youth",
  "abstract": "When a girl grows up with an authoritarian (cold and controlling) parent, the trauma causes her to develop narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) in her young adult years. NPD hinders her ability from forming healthy relationships with her mother and friends but especially with herself. In order to escape any uncomfortable emotion, she utilizes the coping mechanism of committing non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). This creative work applies the theory of NPD and NSSI. It is written in the form of a narrative poetry to show the cause of NPD and its coping mechanism in our society. There will be twenty-three poems that show the progression of Renee's childhood until young adult experiences that cause her to struggle with NPD. Whenever people react negatively against her behavior, she applies NSSI to deal with the response. This creative work shows that NPD can be a serious problem since it may lead to a dangerous coping mechanism called NSSI.",
