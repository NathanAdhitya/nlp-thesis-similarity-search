  "title": "A Study betweeen Chinese Indonesian and Javanese speakers in expression of disagreement in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "Disagreement is considered as an act that threatens someone's positive face. In this case, one is supposed to consider whom she talks to and in what situation. There are some factors that influence people in expressing disagreement such as ethnic background between the speaker and the interlocutor. From these factors, the writer is interested in analyzing disagreement, particularly about what kinds of linguistic choices that are used the most in expressing disagreement. The data of this study were taken from questionnaires distributed to 10 educated Chinese Indonesian and 10 educated Javanese from EF (English First). The data were categorized based on Garcia 's classification (1989) concerning confrontational and non confrontational devices. From the analysis, the writer found out that two of non confrontational devices, that is \"Giving reason\" is used the most by educated Chinese Indonesian when they disagree to the addressee. They tend to give reason as its functions to explain why they disagree. The second one is \"Downtoned suggestions\". It is frequently used by educated Javanese when they disagree to the addressee. They tend to give suggestion as its functions to help each other in solving the problem.",
