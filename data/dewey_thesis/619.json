  "title": "The Study of Deixis in ten stories taken from the book of A 2nd Helping of Chicken Soup For The Soul",
  "abstract": "In studying English, we may not be familiar with the term deixis since it is becoming the part of a language. In studying deixis, it may leads us to the confusion because deixis is a two sides of reference. It may refers to person, place and time. For example, when we utter: \"Hey you, come herel\", the person deixis you and place deixis here may confuse us since we do not know whom it refers to and where the exact place is. That is why the writer wants to analyze the deixis that appear in a written language. The writer is interested in analyzing the deixis in ten stories taken from the book of A 2nd Helping of Chicken Soup for The Soul. For the theory, she uses Levinson's theory for collecting the data, and there are other theories taken from other researchers such as Lyons, Hurford and Heasley, Dillon and so on used in this study. In her analysis, she found out that person deixis is mostly used in the whole stories and successively it is followed by place deixis and time deixis. From this study, the writer finds out that the use of deixis may not lead us to confusion if we know the exact references mentioned by the speaker.",
