  "title": "Marriage as a reward for Disney Princesses",
  "abstract": "This study focuses on the first generation of Disney Princess, which are Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora. Its goal is to find the meaning of marriage for the princesses that happen in the animations. The theories that are used for this study is the ideology of patriarchy, “Angel in the House” concept, and “Damsel in Distress” concept, which affect the characters in the animations. In this analysis, I find out that the meaning of marriage for the princesses is as a reward for them. The lives that the princesses have gone through throughout the movies were full of misery. However, despite their hardship, they give good examples in being the ideal women according to the ideology of patriarchy. Although by being the perfect women makes their suffering worse, it brings them to obtain a reward in the end. The princesses are seen to be the ones who get the “happy ending” after following the rule of patriarchy. Thus, through their animations, Disney wants to show the audience about the ideology of patriarchy which shapes women in order to get a reward by getting married.",
