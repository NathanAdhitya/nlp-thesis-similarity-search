  "title": "Mirroring relationship between Thelma and Jessie in Marsha Norman's 'Night, Mother",
  "abstract": "This study wants to discuss about the mirroring relationship between mother and daughter. Mother-daughter relationship can be included into a contemporary issue because it is still relevant nowadays. This relationship deals with feminism movement which is still emerging nowadays. Moreover, this study also aims to find out whether the mirroring relationship between mother and daughter occurs in Marsha Norman's `Night, Mother. I also would like to find out the effects of the mirroring relationship on them as individual being. Therefore, the characteristics of mirroring relationship constructed by Kristin Hanson are needed to reveal how the mirroring relationship works on Thelma and Jessie. In addition, it also needs the concept of mother-daughter relationship and the theory of object-relations to find out the effects of mirroring relationship and support the characteristics of mirroring relationship. The mirroring relationship of Thelma and Jessie deals with their interrelated subjectivities, the mother-daughter's cycle, and the intense identification of both sides.",
