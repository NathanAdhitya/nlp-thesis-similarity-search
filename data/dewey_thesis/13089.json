  "title": "A Study of wild's moral views toward his criminal action in Henry Fielding's Jonathan Wild",
  "abstract": "This thesis deals with an analysis of Jonathan Wild's moral views in Henry Fielding's Jonathan Wild. The writer is going to discuss the factors that make Wild become a man without morality. The writer also wants to know what kind of man Wild is and how regards his crime. Through charaterization and conflict as well as setting, the writer wants to show that Wild's views are against society's moral views. Wild as the main character in this novel experiences many inner and outer factors which cause him to become a man without morality as the society judges him. The inner factors will show how the character has to struggle against his hardship of life and how his personality is changed. While the outer factors will show how the background of the main character, the situation at that time, the social injustice and the other people who serve as a device to show his immoral life; influence him so much both in his morality and his moral views. Through the analysis, the writer finds that Jonathan Wild is a man who elevates criminality. He never feels sorry for his crime since he finds that by becoming a criminal he will survive. Therefore, what the society jugdes him as a man without morality is absolutely correct.",
