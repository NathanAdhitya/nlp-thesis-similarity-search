  "title": "Numerical studies of reinforced concrete beam-column joints subjected to cyclic loading",
  "abstract": "Interaction of forces and moments in a beam-column joint is complex and most of the time nonlinear. Thus, a simple, global model is insufficient to estimate the performance and behavior of the joint. Nonlinear finite element analysis results of an interior monolithic beam-column joint using VecTor2 with the results validated against an experimental test are presented. The nonlinear finite element modeling reported herein was first calibrated using results from previous experimental studies. The analysis results in terms of force-drift ratio curves and crack patterns were then compared to the experimental results. In general, the results obtained from VecTor2 were satisfactory, but in some cases the program could not accurately capture the force degradation observed in specimens with shear failure. Moreover, the crack patterns were not accurately captured. Nevertheless, VecTor2 can still estimate the peak force well for all specimens in this study.",
