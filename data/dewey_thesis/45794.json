  "title": "The impact of promotion mix towards purchase intention of Mouthwash Brand X",
  "abstract": "In Indonesia, the number of mouthwash users is still small, but currently, the mouthwash category is growing and has a vast potential market. As a market leader in the mouthwash category, Brand X has to gain more consumers to start using mouthwash to enlarge overall mouthwash market. To generate new users, Brand X needs to communicate and promote its product. Currently, Brand X uses advertising, sales promotion, event and experience, word of mouth marketing, and personal selling for its promotion mix. This research aims to analyze the impact of the promotion mix elements in increasing consumer purchase intention of Brand X. The data were gathered using judgment sampling by distributing a questionnaire to people who have visited Brand Xâ€™s event. Then, the data was analyzed using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis to check the impact of simultaneous and individual promotion activity towards consumer purchase intention. The result shows that advertising, sales promotion, event and experience, word of mouth marketing, and personal selling simultaneously have a significant impact on purchase intention. However, the individual result shows that only the secret sale has a substantial effect on consumer purchase intention.",
