  "title": "Blake's vision and portrayal of children's life as seen in Song of Innocence and Songs of Experience",
  "abstract": "In this thesis, the writer prefers to analyze Blake's Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience because she is interested in the idea of children's life as revealed by the poet, William Blake in these two Songs. Blake as a Romantic poet combines his imagination on the vision of the so-called ideal childhood and the reality of children's life in the eighteenth century. He sees that children's life in reality is far from the ideal one, in which children are happy and joyful, filled with parental love and protection and peace, and they live with their spontaneity and freedom. The analysis of the so-called ideal childhood will be on ^introduction\", \"The Echoing Green\", \"The Little Black Boy\", \"Laughing Song\", \"Nurse's Song\", and ^Spring^\" in Songs of Innocence. It is continued by the analysis on Blake's portrayal of children's life in reality as seen in \"The Little Black Boy\", \"The Chimney Sweeper\", \"The Little Boy Lost\", \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, and \"The Chimney Sweeper\", \"The Little Boy Lost\", \"The School Boy\" in Songs of Experience. This thesis will illustrate the feeling of the children who undergo the different situations, in the ideal life and in reality. The result of this thesis can be used as the comment of poor children's life nowadays as it commented the one in the eighteenth century.",
