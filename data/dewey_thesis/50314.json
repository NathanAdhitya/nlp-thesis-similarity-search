  "title": "Patriarchal domination in the novel and film Imperfect : an adaptation study",
  "abstract": "This study deals with the adaptation of an Indonesian novel entitled Imperfect (2019) by Meira Anastasia into a film entitled similarly, Imperfect (2019) by Ernest Prakarsa. Although there are differences between the novel and the film adaptation, they have similarities in terms of the main issue of women’s physical insecurities. Considering that aspect, this thesis aims to reveal that despite the differences in the storyline and characterization, both the novel and the adaptation bear similarities concerning the women’s struggle for self-acceptance under patriarchal domination. This study utilizes the theory of adaptation and patriarchal beauty standards to analyze both the novel and the film adaptation. It is found out that the protagonist’s physical insecurities are dispersed into several women characters in the film to relate with women's physical insecurities in general, and the coercion of beauty standards becomes the main cause of women’s insecurities in both the novel and the film. Moreover, it is perceived that despite the adapters’ aim to raise the issue of women's physical insecurities and criticize the patriarchal standard of beauty, both the novel and the adaptation even indicate the persistence of patriarchal domination.",
