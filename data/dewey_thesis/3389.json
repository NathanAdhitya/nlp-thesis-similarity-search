  "title": "A Study on the processes of the main female's paranoid schizophrenia in Sidney Sheldon's tell me your dreams",
  "abstract": "This is a study about finding the processes of the main female?s character in Sidney Sheldon?s Tell Me Your Dreams. In this study, I will pay attention to how the factors around her affect her personality and leads her to a paranoid condition. I will use Sigmund Freud?s theory of mental disorder to analyze the psychological condition of the main female?s character. In the analyzing, I know that the mental disorder of the main female?s character in Sidney Sheldon?s Tell Me Your Dreams is influenced by her fear to her family, her strange experiences that are done by her alter egos, and her surroundings that will lead her to her paranoid schizophrenia condition. At the end of this study, I can conclude that her behaviors and attitudes visualize the paranoid schizophrenia?s characteristics. She becomes suspicious to her surroundings, fears for unreasonable condition around her, and starts to have delusions and hallucinations to everything around her. Then, when she is facing the trial because of the murder case, her paranoid schizophrenia really shows up because she does not have any idea about the murders at all. All the murders are done by her alter ego. She suffers Multiple Personality Disorder with the presence of alter ego as one of the characteristics.",
