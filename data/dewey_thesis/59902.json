  "abstract": "In this globalisation era, energy sector is crucial and contribute for Indonesia's economic development and societal progress. This study analyzes the business and financial performance of PT. Bayan Resources Tbk (BYAN) over a three-year period from 2020 to 2022, juxtaposed with PT. Indo Tambangraya Megah Tbk (ITMG). Leveraging secondary data from financial statements, journals, and news articles, alongside frameworks like Porter's Five Forces and SWOT analysis, the research identifies BYAN's success factors. These include strategic entry barriers, network utilization, cost efficiency, diversified operations, and forward-looking investments in projects like the Tabang and Solar Cell initiatives. Limitations include reliance on public disclosures, sector-specific challenges, and the researcher's accounting background. Despite these constraints, the study contributes a fresh perspective on the coal and mining sector, offering valuable insights into strategic imperatives crucial for sustained success amidst evolving market dynamics and competitive pressures.",
