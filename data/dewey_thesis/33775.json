  "abstract": "This report contains the progress and result of my internship at SMSTiming as a developer. This assignment is carried out by me, Michael Pratama, as a final year student of Information & Communication Technology at Fontys University of Applied Science. The main point of this graduation project is to re-develop Fast 4 Point of Sales software that is responsible for the payment and sales flow into the new Fast 5 Booking software together with the Configuration software to configure the Booking software that are based on the companyâ€™s new framework, Fast framework. Every part of the software has some general steps before it is delivered to the client that is flow designing, UI Design, coding, unit testing, refactoring, UI coding, UI Polishing and the last but not least is Acceptance testing. Before starting the development process, I did some research which become the foundation of how I finish this project in time because everything about this framework is new to me. Though there were several problems during the development process, I could face it thanks to the help of my amazing colleagues who are experienced in developing.",
