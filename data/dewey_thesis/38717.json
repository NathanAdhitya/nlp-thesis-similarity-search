  "title": "The impact of brand equity on the customers' purchase intention: a case of Zara in Indonesia",
  "abstract": "In recent years, fashion industry has become one of the important sectors in Indonesia. Thus, competitors such as H&M, Forever 21 and Uniqlo rushes to dominate Indonesia's market. The higher competition in the industry forces Zara to strengthen its position by building its brand equity, which can trigger the customer's purchase intention. Therefore, this research aims to analyze the impact of brand equity on the customer's purchase intention of Zara's products. This research will analyze the conceptualization of brand equity adopted from Aaker, which consists of brand awareness, brand association, perceived quality, and brand loyalty. Ninety-two samples of Zara's customer domiciled in Surabaya are used in this research. Those samples are analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The result shows perceived quality and brand loyalty significantly influence customer's purchase intention of Zara's products. However, brand awareness and brand association are not significant in influencing customer's purchase intention.",
