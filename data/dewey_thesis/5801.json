  "title": "Code mixing used in Radio Program 'Suegele Rek' of Suzana Radio FM",
  "abstract": "This research is to analyze code mixing done by the announcers and callers in a talk show program called Suegele Lek on Susana Radio FM. The main purpose of this study is to find out about the kind of a code mixing that is most frequently used, why they arise in the data and what language components which are mostly mixed up by the announcers and callers. I doing this study the writer uses some theories such as a theory of a code mixing and the purpose of mixing the code by Holmes and Wardaugh, discourse analysis by McCharty, and supporting theory about a language standardization in a diglossic situation by Albert Valdman. In collecting the data, the writer recorded the program for a duration of three hours in a day of the show and then she transcribed it so that the writer can analyze it. Furthermore, from the findings the writer discovered that the announcers dominated the mixing code than the callers, yet, they have the same purpose in mixing the code that is, mostly, to show solidarity. Additionally, through this research the writer found the way the presenters use a non standard language favored by the audiences.",
