  "title": "The Consonant development of a twenty-six-months-old Chinese Indonesian boy",
  "abstract": "This study is about the development experienced by twenty six months little boy in producing consonants and the way consonants are combined in producing words. The researcher used the articulatory description of consonants as suggested by Godby (1982), and, the Indonesian consonants description, as suggested by Hasan Alwi (2003). The subject of study is a twenty six months old Chinese-Indonesian little boy who has a speech delay. The observation was done in three stages in a four months period. The subject?s consonant production was observed when he underwent speech training because he was autistic and in his free time. The result is, there are some developments in his ability to produce consonants. The consonant /r/, for example, in the first and second week observation the subject was able to produce it as /y/, whereas in the third week observation, he was able to produce the /r/ sound. The word rambutan (rambutan fruit), was pronounced [utan] in the first week observation, and [yabutan] in the second week observation, but, [rabutan] in the third week observation.",
