  "title": "The Study of swear words in Alexander Solzhenitsyn's one day the life of Ivan Denisovich through pragmatic and stylistic approach",
  "abstract": "Generally, swear words are words which were \"not only considered inappropriate for certain context, but also forbidden in most communicative events\" (Trudgill, 1974:29-31) however, regardless the fact that swear words were condemned to use, their presence was undeniable, and it did, exist in our community. The writer used theory of Pragmatic written by George Yule (1996). This theory is supported by theory of Discourse written by Guy Cook (1994); Speech Acts theory written by Brown and Yule (1984); the theory of Locution, Illocution and Perlocution written by Austin and Searle (1970) to understand the purpose; and the last is the theory swear words written by Huges (1991). The writer used descriptive-quantitative approach in doing this research. There are 116 swear words uttered by the characters. The data was taken from the novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich written by Alexander Solhenitsyn. The writer only observed the swear words which appear in the novel. The result shows that most of the swear words belong to Declaratives, and then followed by Representatives. In Declaratives, the highest action is cursing; while in Representatives the highest action is describing.",
