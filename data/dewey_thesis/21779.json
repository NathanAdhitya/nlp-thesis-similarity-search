  "abstract": "Anna Fitzgerald is the main character in the My Sister?s Keeper who suffers from the violation of the body rights. I emphasize my research in finding how the parents violate Anna?s body rights and how Anna regains the rights of her own body. The main purpose of this study is to reveal the ways Anna?s parents violate Anna?s body rights. Next, I would discuss to find Anna?s way of regaining her body rights. To help me finding the answer, I use the theory of ownership of the human body by Henk A.M.J. ten Have and Jos V.M. Welie since the concepts are most suitable to find out the way that her parents use to violate her body rights, using seemingly democratic approach and force. In the study, I have discovered that underage child certainly can make her objections when her body rights are violated by her parents. Finally, she can get the medical emancipation for her own body. In addition, I have discovered also that Anna?s effort to regains her body rights bring great result to her life and she is able to get a justice.",
