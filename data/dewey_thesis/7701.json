  "title": "Persuasive strategies through the illocutionary acts of Alex, Gloria and Marty in persuading each other in Madagaskar",
  "abstract": "Persuasion is an interesting topic to be discussed. As a communication process of altering other?s belief, value and attitude, persuasion can be accomplished through persuasive strategies that are co-active and combative strategies (Simons, 1976). These strategies need to be communicated and illocutionary act as the act of what one does in saying something (Austin, 1962) can communicate the persuasive strategies. The source of the data is ?Madagascar?, in which the three main characters there, Alex, Gloria and Marty, like to persuade each other. The writer used descriptive qualitative approach. Based on the data analysis, the writer found the relation between illocutionary act and persuasive strategy that can be seen from the illocutionary act in each persuasive strategy. Co-active strategies have 16 illocutionary acts and combative strategies have 9 illocutionary acts. Co-active strategies has more illocutionary acts rather than combative strategies because in this kind of conversation (persuasive communication), the persuaders there like to use subtle ways and emphasize on their friendship while persuading. This research is useful for anyone who is interested in Persuasion and its relationship to the illocutionary acts of the persuader. In addition, this research helps the readers to be more critical as a persuader and persuadee.",
