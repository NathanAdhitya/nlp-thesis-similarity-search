  "title": "A Study of theme through characters, plot and settings in Eugene O'Neill beyond the horizon",
  "abstract": "This thesis is especially dedicated to explore the theme of Eugene O'Neill's first Pulitzer Prize winner, Beyond the Horizon. In exploring and finding out what the theme of this play is, the write.r analyses it through the study of characters, plot and settings. In studying the characters, the writer is going to analyse the nature of the characters : Robert Mayo, Ruth Atkins and also Andrew Mayo. At the same time, she will also observe the changes undergone by each of them which are believed to be drastic and pathetic. Up to this phrase, she will relate the changes to their nature and find out the reasons. In the plot, the writer w ill analyse what factors are underlying the conflicts of each character related to the disclosure of the central idea of the play. Realizing that the study of characters and plot is not enough, the setting of time and place together with tone and atmosphere will be thoroughly analysed because the writer strongly believes that the theme is also fully and facsinatingly developed in this element of literature. Through the complete analysis of this play, the writer concludes with a simple yet essential message from the author which is believed as the \"key\" to everyone's success and happiness.",
