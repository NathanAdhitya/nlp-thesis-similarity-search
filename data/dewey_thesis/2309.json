  "abstract": "Aldous Huxley and George Orwell have similarities in using their main characters to satirize the tendencies and values in the contemporary societies that do not agree with them. John the Savage and Winston Smith are used to satirize the abuse of power using science and technology in the contemporary societies that causes the destruction of individuality which is the essence of human life. They are in love with the main female characters, Lenina Crowne and Julia, who commit the deviations of morality. Through them, the tendenccies such as free-sex, ignorance and the other ways of life of the modern people are portrayed. They are also used to uncover the hypocrisy and manipulations done by the tyrants. Above all, through all the main characters, the cruelties of totalitarian rulers, and the horrible totalitarian societies are revealed.",
