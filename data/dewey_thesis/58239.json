  "abstract": "Digital media recommendation algorithms play a pivotal role in providing personalized and engaging experiences for users in today's digital landscape. By considering individual preferences and behaviors, the algorithms can deliver tailored content suggestions that align with user interests. Techniques like item-based filtering, user-based filtering, and contextual recommendation enable personalized recommendations based on different factors, such as item similarity, user similarity, and contextual relevance. In conclusion, digital media recommendation algorithms leverage user data, content characteristics, and advanced machine learning techniques to provide personalized and engaging experiences. By understanding user preferences, these algorithms enhance user satisfaction, drive engagement, and contribute to the success of digital media platforms in today's dynamic digital landscape. This study will be beneficial for the development of IDN Media that is in the process of utilizing recommendation system for the first time, since the algorithms created using basic preliminary analysis and Market Basket Analysis.",
