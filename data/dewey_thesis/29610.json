Moreover, Sibyl System, as the governing system, shows signs of being the cause of the dystopian society in Psycho Pass even though it was designed for the purpose of creating utopia. To find out more about this, the writer analyzes each characteristic of the dystopian society and traces their causes to Sibyl System’s aspects. Through the analysis, by comparing Sibyl System’s aspects to six of the Panopticon’s aspects, it is found out that Sibyl System is indeed a Panopticon, and these panoptic aspects, like the royal menagerie function, with its loopholes are the causes of the dystopian society.
