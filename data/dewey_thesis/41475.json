  "abstract": "The writer of this thesis would like to discuss one of Strindberg's play The Father. In this play it is described that the main character, the Captain, is an unhappy man whose life is covered by terrible pain in his mind and feeling. It seems that his pain is entirely caused by his serious conflicts with the other characters that he faces during his life. Apparently, the Captain here becomes the victim of the conflicts which appear between him and the other characters, whereas the other characters unconsciously play their roles as the torturers toward the Captain. As a result those conflicts lead the Captain to suffer \"brain-battles\" which eventually drive him to his death. From this play, the writer is curious to analyze the process of how conflicts affect the Captain psychologically which finally lead him to his death. Through this study, the writer wants to show how the complexity and the danger of conflicts in human life and how its power destroy one's life destructively as what the Captain experiences in The Father.",
