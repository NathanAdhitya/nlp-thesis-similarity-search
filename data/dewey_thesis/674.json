  "abstract": "This research is dealing with the utterances produced by two-and-a- half- year old Indonesian boy. The topic being discussed here is limited into the theory of case relation originated from Fillmore. In this research, the writer wants to find out whether or not there is a relation between the type of the case relation and the kind of sentences produced by the subject. Therefore, the writer recorded all the utterances produced by the subject for the period of 3 hours formally in one whole month. Then, the writer classified the utterances into one-word utterances, two-word utterances, three-word utterances and four-word utterances. Besides doing the classification based on the length of utterances, the writer also classified the utterances in terms, of the theory of Nelson Francis about types of sentences such as statements, requests, calls, greetings, eclamations, and questions. However, in this research, the writer only analyzed statements and requests, because these two types were what mostly produced by the subject. Then, after having found all the types of case relation of each utterance, the writer mapped up the types of the case relation based on type of sentences produced by the subject. From here then the writer saw that there was a relation between the type of case relation and the type Of sentence, because certain type of case relation always occurs on certain type of sentence.",
