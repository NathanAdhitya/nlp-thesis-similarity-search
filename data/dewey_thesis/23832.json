  "abstract": "This study observed the negotiation phase and coercive strategies performed by Chinese and Javanese customers in haggling over cellular phones toward Javanese sellers. It focused on the comparison how these two ethnics employed the negotiation phases and coercive strategies in haggling over cellular phones. The data were taken from the recorded conversation of 20 Chinese and 20 Javanese customers to Javanese sellers. Then, the data were analyzed by Negotiation Phases by Greenhalgh (2001) and Coercive Strategies by Gibbons, Bradac, and Busch (1992). The findings show that the Chinese customers had the tendency to employ more on information gathering and bidding phases in the negotiation phases than Javanese customers. Moreover, the Chinese customers also performed more coercive strategies in lie and sentence structure of a threat than Javanese customers.",
