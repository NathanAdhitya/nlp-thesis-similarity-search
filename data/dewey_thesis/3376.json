  "title": "A Sociolinguistic study of code mixing used by a Totok Chinese-Indonesian mother and her son in the family in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "Code mixing is a linguistic phenomenon, which we often meet on our everyday life as multilingual society. It was the use of the elements of one language within a sentence in another language (Nababan, 1978). It also occurred in our conversations in the family. The totok Chinese Indonesian families in Surabaya also use codes to talk to their family. I used descriptive-qualitative approach in order to get the in depth data about the background of a totok Chinese Indonesian mother and her son. I also used myself as the instrument and the observer to collect the data through note taking and interviews. In the analysis, after having collected the data, I discussed and interpretated them. The result of this study indicates that there is a totok Chinese Indonesian family in Surabaya, especially a mother and her son, which prefer to use Chinese codes even though they mastered the Chinese language. They used Indonesian and Javanese language with Chinese codes because since they were babies their parents used to communicate using Indonesia. Another factor is that they were afraid their Chinese language would be infected with Indonesian dialect.",
