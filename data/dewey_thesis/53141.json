  "title": "Raising CV Petra Kharisma Abadi's brand awareness to its target market using a new logo, brand name, and slogan",
  "abstract": "CV Petra Kharisma Abadi, now PeKA, is a company that makes and sells food-boxes in Magelang and Kedu areas. The customers are mainly from Magelang, 60% females 40% males, aged between 25-55 years. The main problem that I have found from the customer survey is lack of brand awareness, because the target customers cannot recognize the name of the company and its’ product. From the customer survey, I found that the solutions are making a new brand name, logo, and slogan. Besides, the company has to highlight the USPs (durability, beauty, and low price). PeKA is chosen as the new brand name because it is easily remembered. The slogan is in semi-formal Indonesian, highlighting the products’ USPs. I used the theories that focuses to my main subjects, which are brand awareness, brand name, logo, and slogan. There are three benefits from the solution, target customers can be more familiar with the company (PeKA), can boost their sales by having the target market’s trust, and can later have a correct method of promotions after having a good branding.",
