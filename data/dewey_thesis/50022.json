  "abstract": "Animation has been around for ages. One popular animation is Avatar: The Last Airbender, a TV series about Aang, who feels pressured by his responsibility to end a world war. This TV series intrigues me to analyze Aang’s journey, as the main character, in becoming a hero. In this study, I aim to analyze the stressors that result in Aang’s psychological distress, how he copes with them, and how he develops into a hero. To find out about the three aforementioned points, I use theories on psychological distress and coping mechanisms. My analysis demonstrates that Aang shows symptoms of psychological distress such as insomnia and anxiety, caused by three stressors: his fear of accepting his new identity and responsibility, his shame, and his fear of the war and the possibility of losing the war. To deal with those stressors, Aang adopts two coping mechanisms: emotion-focused (avoidance, seeking social support for emotional purposes, and acceptance), and problem-focused (seeking social support for instrumental purposes, planning, and problem-solving). By the end of the series, Aang has become a hero by developing into a selfless and benevolent humanitarian who used his intelligence and integrity to end the war.",
