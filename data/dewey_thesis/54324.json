  "title": "Waterfall methodology for web dashboard improvement at aplikasi Super",
  "abstract": "Incoming requests from stakeholders inside a company, including the demands from the environment that trigger improvements, are always causing significant issues. Those issues need to be handled appropriately by the managers in charge. Specifically, at Aplikasi Super, they are the Product/Project Managers from the Product and Technology Department. As the liaison between different departments, the role is very crucial for the growth and existence of the company. To burgeon the role, several methods are available to be used. With mainly using a web dashboard to empower various business processes in the company, Product/Project Managers will need to make coherent and continuous improvements. This research attempts to determine whether the Waterfall Methodology, a model mainly used for software developments, suits the business done at the company. It is generally described as an improvement method towards problems or weaknesses. With its methodology prescribed as a waterfall that moves from a higher level to a lower one, the model is expected to anticipate and solve problems.",
