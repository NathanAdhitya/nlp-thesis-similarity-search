  "abstract": "The increasing uses ofsocial media leads to increasing uses ofendorsement in social media. At the same time, Instagram emerges as one social media giant with rapid growth in users. However, in implementing endorsement in Instagram, business owners have to be sure whether using celebrity endorsers for endorsing their products is really effective. Therefore, this research aims to analyze if Instagram endorsement indeed has significant influence towards consumer purchase intention and understand what factors of endorsement has the most significant impact. It utilizes TEARS, consisting of Trustworthiness, Expertise, Attractiveness, Respect and Similarity (internal factors which makes an endorser), as the concephlal framework. In order to do so, this research uses simple random sampling. The data comes from 100 valid respondents' responses and is processed using multiple regression. The result shows that celebrity endorsement in Instagram through TEARS model has significant impact towards purchase intention, with Expertise as the most significant variable among other TEARS variables.",
