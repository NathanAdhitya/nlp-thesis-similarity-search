  "title": "Comparing translation strategies of two different translators of 'Tintin In Tibet'",
  "abstract": "This study discusses the differences in Indonesian translations of 'Tintin in Tibet' published by two publishers. Using a qualitative analysis method, the translation strategies used in this book were analyzed using the theory from Mona Baker (2018). The rank of the most dominant strategies, from the most frequent to the less, used by both publishers are paraphrased using the unrelated word, paraphrase using the related word, cultural substitution, omission, and less expressive word. The naturalness of the translation is affected by the strategies and the character and context's traits. In the swear words translation, the best strategy used to translate the swear words are cultural substitution. It is better than other strategies because the readers can understand more if familiar swear words are used. In conclusion, both translators have different natural translation results, but in the swear word translation, the translator of Indira provides more natural translation.",
