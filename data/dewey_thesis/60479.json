  "title": "Power and resistance in \"The Gifted\" Thai series",
  "abstract": "The Thai television series The Gifted by Patha Thongpan has interested me and become the subject of this study. This study aims to find out the ways the school maintains its power over the students and how the students fight against the school's power. The theory of power and resistance by Michel Foucault is applied in this analysis. The series portrays the struggle for power and control in the classroom, mirroring actual situations in which people have to deal with repressive system and rules. This analysis does not only dive deep into the fictional world of the series but also serves as a mirror reflecting the power struggles and challenges faced by the school and students in real-life educational institutions. In order to ensure that every student's opinion is heard and respected, oppressive authority can be destroyed by adopting an equal system and rules.",
