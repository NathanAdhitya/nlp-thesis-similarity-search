  "abstract": "Customers are important thing for every kind of business, because without customers a business cannot survive. But customers are not enough, it needs loyal customers. But how can the customers be loyal? The customers can be loyal when their need is satisfied. To satisfy it, a business needs to know the background of its customers. And to make it simple, customer segmentation must be done. The research problem for this research is how the segmentation of customer of Paradijs restaurant is. The customers would be segmented using the four major variables (geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioral). The samples of this thesis are 80 respondents. The respondents are the customers that drink wine, because wine drinkers are part of the customers that are really important for the restaurant, because they spend more money than the customers that drink soft drink or beer. The data that is already collected would be used by the researchers to make recommendation about the marketing strategy for Paradijs restaurant.",
