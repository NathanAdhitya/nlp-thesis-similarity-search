  "abstract": "It is inevitable for a company to have a product that fails in the market. In the paint industry, it is essential to be the pioneer but at the same time, make sure that the product benefits are according to market needs. Thus make the goal of this research is to improve Avianâ€™s current new product development, launching, and marketing process to minimize and eliminate future product failure. It will be done by comparing the theories with what the company currently uses to find out what are the things that need to be improved from the process. To interviewing some of the Avian employees, consumers and store owners & wholesalers are also done to know what factor they think influence product success and failure. Through the comparison, it shows that the company need to have a more structured process, and some steps are missing. More thorough market research and market testing should be done to understand better what the market needs. For the marketing strategy, they should shift a certain percentage of their budget and allocate more for advertising to less popular products to increase their market awareness.",
