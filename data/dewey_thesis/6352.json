  "abstract": "Being a good communicator is not always easy for everyone, it is a matter of how the speaker and the hearer understand each other when they are communicating. Cross-examination is also a communication between two people, each person has his/her own aim and mostly, s/he will try to convince others of his/her idea to the other. Therefore, it is important to understand how each person uses strategy in order to convince others of his/her idea. In order to know about the strategy of convincing idea, the writer uses the theory of function that related to the illocutionary acts that show the different acts of an utterance. Moreover, the writer uses the crossexamination in \"Primal Fear\" as the source of data since it provides the example of convincing ideas done by the District Attorney and the Lawyer toward his/her witness. The writer finds that in the cross-examination, the District Attorney and the Lawyer used some moves that help them to convince others of their idea so that the witness will agree to him/her.",
