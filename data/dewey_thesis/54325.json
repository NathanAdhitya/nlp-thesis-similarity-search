  "title": "Dashboard implementation: monitoring employee's learning and comprehension level at PT XYZ",
  "abstract": "Online-based learning has been an alternative for a company to learn without having meetup sessions with teachers or instructors. Due to the pandemic of Covid-19, all offline learnings were prohibited to reduce the possibility of the Covid-19 spread. However, monitoring the online learning progress can be a new challenge since instructors do not know whether users are studying or not. The dashboard may help instructors or companies monitor the employeeâ€™s learning progress and result in the learning platform. The dashboard will also automate several processes so that the usage of human resources can be minimized to prevent the occurrence of human error during the manual calculation. The dashboard from google data studio will also give users more insights rather than conventional pivoting for the data visualizations. Keywords: dashboard, business intelligence, google data studio, online learning, data visualizations",
