  "title": "A Study of the need of the main characters to wear musk as seen through Eugene O'neill's the Great God Brown",
  "abstract": "The Great God Brown is a play by Eugene O'Neill which exploits the use of mask to dramatize the inner feeling of his main characters. By means of mask, he makes all his main characters in this play wearing masks every time they meet other people. For this reason, I am encouraged to find out the reason why the main characters need to wear masks and also how their dependency on their masks affect them. In analyzing these, I want to prove that their reasons for wearing masks are to fulfill their safety needs, love or belongingness needs and esteem needs. Besides that, I want to prove that the degree of dependency on their masks affects them in different ways. The literary approach that I am going to use is the theory of conflict. And besides that, I also use the theory of \"Motivation\" by Abraham Maslow. By using these theories I analyze that Dion's needs of mask is to get safety needs, esteem needs and love needs, William Brown's needs of masks is to get love needs and esteem needs, and Margaret's needs of masks is to get esteem needs. After I analyze them I conclude that they need mask to help them satisfy their unachievable needs.",
