  "title": "Alceste's rejection towards his society in Moliere's The Misanthrope",
  "abstract": "Moliere is a great French playwright who is known for his outstanding ability in writing classical comedy. He wrote and produced The Misanthrope. This play is a story about the main character, Alceste, who is the misanthrope or a man who hates mankind. This play shows Alceste?s rejection towards his society. Considering the topic, this thesis will discuss two things. First, what are Alceste?s character traits that make him reject his society and second, what are the effects of his rejection towards his society. To analyze this, I use literary approach using characterization and conflict as the tools. Alceste?s character traits, honesty and uncompromising attitude, make him reject his society. As a result, this kind of attitude brings him into consequences. He loses his lawsuit and money, he is ignored by his best friend, and the worst thing is that he loses the woman he loves and he lives in isolation. Finally, the conclusion of this thesis is an extreme principle of life that neglects other people will be a boomerang for the person who does not want to be more tolerant in his social life.",
