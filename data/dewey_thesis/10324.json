  "abstract": "This research paper discusses the factors causing the inefficiency of finished products distribution. The factors will be emphasized on the material procurement; where the process in PT. XYZ is taken as the sample for this research. Moreover, in this research paper, there are several possible factors (which are categorized as internal and external factors) to be analyzed to determine which factor significantly causes the inefficiency of the finished products delivery to the customers. In addition, there are two hypotheses used in this research paper. In order to determine whether the hypotheses are accepted or rejected, the writers analyze it as the causal study using both qualitative and quantitative research. In doing the quantitative analysis, the data needed are collected using quota sampling with purposive method to ensure that the data being analyzed will be able to answer the research problem. The data then will be analyzed using regression analysis to evaluate the significance of the relationship between each factor to the dependent variable. As the result, all factors included in internal and external factors are significantly causing the lateness in delivery of finished products to the customers and decision making made by purchasing is the most dominant one.",
