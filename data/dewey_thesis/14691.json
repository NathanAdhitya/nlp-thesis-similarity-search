  "title": "Robert Neville?s crisis in Richard Matheson?s I Am Legend",
  "abstract": "This study aims to reveal the cause of the crisis that happens in Robert Neville?s life as the main character of Richard Matheson?s I Am Legend. Regarding the changes that occur in life, Robert Neville exposes a prolonged crisis. The tragic ending where Robert Neville gives up to the society triggers an intriguing question whether the crisis is needed to be overcome or not. Altogether, I am interested in questioning why actually Neville triggers into a crisis. Therefore, the definition of crisis and some themes attached in the theory of existentialism is needed in revealing the complexity of the causes of Neville?s crisis. The causes of crisis are revealed through his experience of family loss, the changing concept of God, subjective freedom, and alienation. Since life is too hard for Neville to bear, he finally thinks that he has no significance in life. As a result, Robert Neville gives up his life.",
