It follows Joko Damar's journey from poverty to success, highlighting his trials and transformation. Using a slice-of-life approach, the screenplay conveys that success is achievable through adaptation, hard work, and transcending societal limitations. It challenges biases, inspires self-belief, and prompts reflection on individual potential. The narrative examines the interplay between social structures and personal agency, showcasing Joko's navigation of his initial habitus. By depicting his evolving mindset and skills, the story celebrates resilience while critiquing systemic barriers to social mobility, encouraging viewers to consider their own growth potential and broader societal implications.",
