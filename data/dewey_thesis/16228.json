  "title": "A Study of other characters' influences on laura in tennessee william the glass menagerie",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of the characters in Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie. I am interested in analyzing the changes that happen in Laura. The analysis will show Laura's relationship with the other characters and the influences of the other characters on Laura's changes. Thus, in doing the analysis, I use the theory of characterization and conflict. Laura, is a very shy girl who chooses to escape from reality to her own world of glass menageries. She is facing the failure of fulfilling her mother's ambition for her and also the failure of keeping the family together, which leads her to escape from the failures. Laura, then, meets Jim who is able to influence her to be more confident with herself. Laura is being influenced by the other characters, Amanda, Tom and Jim in different ways.",
