Maru design is a strategic and brand design agency which provides the company with their services of branding and rebranding. The services help their client to create and develop brands to solve the problem that they have, mainly for the marketing development of companies. In their services, they need to research about the product of the client’s brand or prospect’s brand, but there is no clear procedure to do market research even though it is an important step to attract prospect and before they develop the brand. Thus, marketing research guideline is needed for maru design. The guideline is used as procedures by which to determine a course of action.
