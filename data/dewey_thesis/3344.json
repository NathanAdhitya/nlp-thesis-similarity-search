  "title": "The Effects of Marcus' materialistic life style on his children and grandchildren in Helman's The Little Foxes and Another Part of The Forest",
  "abstract": "In this thesis, I discuss the materialistic life style of the Hubbard families. I want to reveal Marcus? materialistic life style as the father or the leader in the Hubbard family and the effects of his materialistic life style on his children and grandchildren. To get criticisms and information about the effects of Marcus? materialistic life style I use library and internet researches. Hellman?s plays The Little Foxes and Another Part of the Forest are the primary data. In my analysis I use literary approach and employ the literary tools of characterization and conflict. I also need the concept of materialistic life style to support my analysis. This play talks about the Hubbards who at last have the same life style as Marcus. The characters discussed here are Marcus (the father), Ben, Oscar, Regina (the children), Leo and Alexandra (the grandchildren). The children were not born to have materialistic life style but are taught by their father in their daily life. As my findings, I prove that the life style of the father is inherited by their children, and transmitted to their grandchildren. They live for money and do not have love. However, one person, Alexandra does not become like the other members of the family because she learns that living like them will result in the same tragedy and even more.",
