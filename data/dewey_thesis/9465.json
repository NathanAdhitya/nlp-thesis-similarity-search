The writer also investigated the perlocutionary acts produced by his interlocutors. The theory of speech act by Austin (1962) was used as the main theory in this research. The writer also used the theory of context by Hymes (1964) in determining the illocutionary and perlocutionary acts. To support the main theory, the writer also used the theories proposed by Hurford and Heasley (1984). In her study, the writer used the descriptive qualitative approach.

The result of the analysis showed that the illocutionary acts produced by Seth Cohen were mocking, offering, requesting, protesting, praising, assuring, naming, admitting, accusing, apologizing, recommending, and warning. His interlocutors expressed verbal and non verbal responses as their perlocutionary acts.",
