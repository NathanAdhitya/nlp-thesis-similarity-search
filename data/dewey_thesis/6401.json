  "abstract": "This study is a qualitative study of the language and identity of a Banjarese man who lives in Surabaya. This study was conducted in order to reveal the connection of the language use with the identity as a Banjarese who lives in Surabaya. To reach the research objectives, some findings from previous studies with similar topic were used as references. From my study I found that language choice, the straight forwardness, the persistence in defending principles can be considered as characterizing his identity as a Banjarese while the use of Javanese and Jakartanese the changing in the language of politeness characterized his changes of identity to become more Javanese.",
