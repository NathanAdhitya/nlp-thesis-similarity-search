  "title": "Speech styles used by Raymond Chin as host of the 20 under 20 Podcast to male and female guests",
  "abstract": "The writer conducted this study to investigate the speech styles used by Raymond Chin, the 20 Under 20 podcast host. The writer did this study to find the speech styles used by Raymond Chin when talking to his male and female guests. In addition, the writer observed the similarities and differences in the speech styles used by Raymond when talking to his male and female guests. In conducting this study, the writer used the theory of speech styles by Chaer and Agustina (2014). Furthermore, this study was done using the qualitative approach. The result of this study was that while Raymond used the consultative, casual, and intimate speech style towards both his male and female guests, Raymond also employed an additional formal speech style toward his female guest. This study shows that Raymond experiences a phenomenon known as speech accommodation which causes Raymond to, consciously or unconsciously, adapt his speech style based on the gender of his guest.",
