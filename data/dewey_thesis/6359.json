  "abstract": "The thesis writer discusses the main female implementation of her unconventional ideas on sex and marriage in Toni Morrison?s Sula. The thesis writer wonders what makes Sula, the main female character has unconventional ideas on sex and marriage, and how the ideas are implemented in her attitude in the novel. The thesis writer wants to reveal the reason why Sula has unconventional ideas on sex and marriage, and the ways Sula implemented in her attitude. Utilizing the literary approach, the thesis writer analyzes Toni Morrison?s Sula by applying literary tools such as characterization, setting, and conflict. Besides, he needs the definition of friendship as the supporting tool to analyze the relationship between Sula as the main female character with Nel. The analysis shows that in the process of implementation ideas on sex and marriage, the main female character undergoes conflicts, until she becomes a new young woman with a new character. The implementation of unconventional ideas on sex and marriage experienced by Sula is for the better of everything. Undoubtedly the implementation of unconventional ideas on sex and marriage eventually makes the main female character become stronger, better and wiser after she has conflicting idea with Nel concerning the unconventional ideas of sex and marriage.",
