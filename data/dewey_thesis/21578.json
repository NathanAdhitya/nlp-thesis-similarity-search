  "title": "A Study of stress pattern in rap songs sung by arrested development and public enemy",
  "abstract": "The world-wide phenomenon of rap music among teenagers intrigued the writer's interest to do a research upon rap songs. Youngsters from the whole world are willing to spend their money on new rap records, any attributes of rap and the rap artists, and any other things relating to rap.This study specifically is an observation on stress pattern of six rap songs sung by Arrested Development and Public Enemy. This focus was set after, dealing much with those songs and studying phonetic theories; and learning that the stress is the likely element that still attracts the rap fans' attention since the already-known important element, intonation (quality of singing in tune), is monotonous. The irregular form is expected to be the stress pattern of those songs consequently. By viewing the rap songs as poetry, literary frame-work was made use. The feet lamb, trochee, anapest, dactyl, spondee and monosyllabic foot were utilised to see the stress pattern of each line, each verse and the entire song. Based on the emergence of those feet, the name of the meter was given when the appearance reached a percent-age of over 50.The calculation of the meters of all the six songs proved the researcher' hypothesis to be true. The most oftenly appearing stress pattern was nothing but free meter.",
