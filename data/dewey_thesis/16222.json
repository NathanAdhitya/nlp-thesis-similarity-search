  "title": "A study on a robust control chart and process capability analysis",
  "abstract": "Control chart is a very extensively used tool in testing that the process is in a state of statistical control. In this study, a robust control chart for variables is proposed, which is based on the Huber's M-Estimator. The Huber's M-Estimator is well-known robust estimator in sense of distributional robustness or outlier resistance. In the proposed chart, the estimation of the process deviation is modified to have a stable level and high power. To compare the performance of the proposed control chart with the classical x-bar chart, come Monte Carlo simulations are performed. The simulation results show that the robust control chart has good performance.",
