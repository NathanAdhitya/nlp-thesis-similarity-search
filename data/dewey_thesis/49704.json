  "abstract": "SPELL ELC (Special Programs for English Language & Literacy English Language and Communication) Sidoarjo was established in 2001. There are three programs that SPELL ELC offers: Academic English Program, Business English Program, and Children English Program. SPELL ELC’s competitor is EF (English First) Sidoarjo. SPELL ELC has a problem that must be solved immediately, which is lacking students outside Sidoarjo. Therefore, the best solution to solve this problem is to make a company profile video. A company profile video is the best solution to overcome the problem because it can reach the customers who live outside Sidoarjo. The company profile video was made by following the theory of Rockman (2017) in order to deliver the information effectively. When making the company profile video, this study conducted a survey and interview in order to get the USP. According to Dandy (2020), this solution will give four benefits for the company. The benefits are: it helps the customers to know the company’s brand, it can cover the company’s shortcomings, it can be an effective promotional tool, and it can build good images for the company",
