  "title": "A Study on the causes of Coco's identity crisis in Wei Hui's Shanghai baby",
  "abstract": "This study deals with the identity crisis that occurs in the main female character in Wei Hui’s Shanghai Baby. I am curious to know about the problem of the main character that leads to identity crisis. I use Erik H. Erikson (1968) theory about identity crisis. The problems that lead to identity crisis included self certainty problem, identity confusion, role confusion, sexual identity, love relationship, and also the problem of intimacy. According to Erikson, these problems can lead to identity crisis. In doing this research, I use psychological approach. I also use a library research and supported with internet sources. From the data that I have collected, I use it in my analysis of the problem. I related Erikson’s theories with the problem in my analysis. Through the analysis, I found that the main female character’s problems can lead to identity crisis. The problems may occur in everyone’s life. When someone cannot overcome the problem, they will experience identity crisis.",
