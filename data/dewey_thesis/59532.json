  "abstract": "This research aims to investigate the contribution of food consumption value in shaping food destination image and behavioral intention from the perspective of foreign tourists in Bali. This study collected data from 201 Bali foreign tourists who explored local food, using Partial Least-Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). In summary, the effect of Food Consumption Value towards Behavioral Intention is partially mediated by food destination image. This suggests that whereas food consumption value directly influences behavioral intention, it also transmits some effect through the way consumers view the destination. This research emphasizes how complex consumer decision-making processes are in this situation, with important roles being played by both direct and mediated effects. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that foreign visitorâ€™s behavioral intentions and perceptions of a place, such as Bali, are greatly influenced by the perceived value of food consumption. The findings highlight how important local food options are in luring visitors and influencing their choices to return to particular locations.",
