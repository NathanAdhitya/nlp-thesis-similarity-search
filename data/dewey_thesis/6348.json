  "abstract": "This thesis is about an analysis of the Indonesian translation from an English book, entitled \"The New Kid?s Book of Bible People\". The writer wants to know what errors occur in the target language. In doing the analysis, the writer uses the theory of Nida and the research done by Djajanegara. The writer uses the theory of Nida in order to know the criteria of a good translation and the writer adopts the methodology of Djajanegara. By using Djajanegara?s methodology, the writer can answer the research questions about what errors that occur in the target language. Djajanegara also used the theory of Nida in doing his research. In collecting the data, the writer takes from the whole forty chapters of the book entitled \"40 Tokoh Alkitab\". Then, the data is divided into four groups, which have syntax errors, lexical errors, punctuation errors, and spelling errors. Based on these groups, the writer counts the total of the errors that cause the translation inaccurate. Then, the writer finds that the biggest error that mostly causes inaccurate translation is lexical errors. Next are spelling errors and then punctuation errors. The least number of errors are syntax errors. In conclusion, the writer finds that lexical errors dealt with the word choice that usually causes change in meaning.",
