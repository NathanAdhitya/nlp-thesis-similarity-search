  "abstract": "The writer conducted this study to investigate the speech styles used by Bagas, the main character in Pakai Hati The Series. This study was done by the writer to find the speech styles used by Bagas when talking to his interlocutors who have different statuses. In addition, the writer observed the similarities and/or differences of the speech styles used by Bagas when talking to his interlocutors who have different statuses. In conducting this study, the writer used the theory of speech styles by Chaer and Agustina (2010) and the theory of standard Indonesian characteristics by Prihantini (2015) and Kridalaksana (2007). Furthermore, this study was done using a qualitative approach. The result of this study showed that Bagas used consultative style, casual style, and intimate style to all his interlocutors. He also used the formal style towards his clients; he did not use the frozen style when talking to his interlocutors. This study showed that Bagas did not differentiate his speech style merely based on status since there were some other factors that might affect his choice of speech style; habit or personality, type or context of the conversation, and social distance factor.",
