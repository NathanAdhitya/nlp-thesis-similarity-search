  "abstract": "This thesis discusses about a motor cycle protection system using remote control. The main components used in the system include a microcontroller AT 89C2051, a unit of modem FSK TCM3105, a transmitter IC BA1404 and a receiver IC LAI260. The working principle of the system concerns data transmission through VHF radio wave, using half duplex FSK modulation, set by a microcontroller. The experiment is conducted to observe the transmitting range from the transmission system installed on the motor-cycle to the receiver system in the remote control, and vice versa. From the experiment, a well established two-way data transmission (half-duplex) between remote control and the protection system on the motor-cycle is achieved. The drawback lies in the fact that the data transmission range from the remote- control to the protection system on the motor-cycle is not really far. This is due to the low transmitting capacity of the remote control. However, this would not be a major problem since only the far reaching communication range from the protection system on the motor cycle to the remote control is expected",
