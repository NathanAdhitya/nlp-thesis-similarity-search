  "abstract": "This thesis discusses sequences in the conversations of some female students who live in a boarding house. The writer has three problems to analyze: the sequences that occur in the conversations, the dominant move, and the effect of the relationships to the sequences. In order to answer those three questions, the writer uses two theories, a main theory, and a supporting theory. For the main theory, she uses Stenstrom' theory about interactional structures. While for the supporting theory, she uses a sociological theory about Social Group from Sunyoto Usman. In this thesis, the writer uses the qualitative approach, which includes recording, segmenting, and analyzing. The data are taken from Petra's female students who live in the boarding house near the campus. After she analyzed the data, she found that there were various sequences which occurred in the conversations but the three most frequently occurred sequences are [I R], [I R R], and [I]. The dominant move is [Response] and the relationships among the subjects affect the exchange. The writer also found that in a close friendship group, the conversation has more variation of exchanges than in a distant friendship group. So that the relationship among the group affect on the variation of exchanges that are used.",
