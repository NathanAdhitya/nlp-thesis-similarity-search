  "abstract": "This creative project is a novel that tells the story of a man, Lukas, and a woman, Sharon. Lukas is a cruel psychopath who kidnaps people and commits drug exploitation on them, and Sharon is one of his victims. Both of them have sordid pasts, and during Sharon’s captivation, they begin to learn each other’s pasts that made them the way they are now. Sharon then suffers an abnormality where she develops an emotional bond with Lukas, which is known as Stockholm syndrome. About the genre, this novel belongs to the genres of psychological thriller and romance, which results in a romantic suspense plot. The themes are about perception, exploring that of the psychopath’s false perception about people’s lives, and purpose, in which we explore both the psychopath and the victim’s contradicting purpose throughout this novel. This novel will also explore the topics of further exploitation after one is kidnapped, especially drug exploitation, several factors that trigger Stockholm syndrome to the victim, and the syndrome’s effects to both the psychopath and the kidnap victim. These are to assist me in conveying my purpose of writing this novel which are to raise the ever-growing issue of kidnapping and drug abuse, so that people could raise their guard more; also, for the people to know the underlying causes of a problematic person’s actions, so they are not quick to judge.",
