  "abstract": "The thesis analyzes the Phantom ?s terrors in Gaston Leroux ?s Phantom of the Opera. I would like to find out the reason the Phantom terrorizes the opera house. Furthermore, I am interested in discussing the way the Phantom terrorizes the opera house. For the analysis, I use literary approach and characterization and conflict by Muller G.H as the theory. By applying these two theories I was able to find the reasons for the Phantom to terrorize the opera house and the way the Phantom terrorizes. My analysis shows that the reason the Phantom terrorize the opera house is his needs. The ways the Phantom terrorizes the opera house is by posing as a ghost, kidnapping, killing and torturing. In the end, my analysis also reveals that understanding each other is important to prevent terror.",
