  "title": "A Study of Orlando's Androgyny in Virginia Woolf's Orlando",
  "abstract": "This thesis is an analysis of Virginia Woolf s novel entitled Orlando. The most significant problem that appears in this novel is about the case of Androgyny. In the story, Orlando, the main character undergoes a sex change that is from male to female. Interestingly, though Orlando is a man, he has never been a purely man. Not only do his physical appearance and mannerisms look feminine, but also his mental qualities are more likely to belong to a woman's. Even after he has turned into a woman, her character remains androgynous as she retains some masculine qualities. Based on this, the thesis writer then intends to describe in what specific way Orlando's character is considered androgynous. Besides, as the novel is greatly influenced by the Victorian age, the writer of this thesis also attempts to discuss about the strict characteristics of the age that almost destroy Orlando's character. To get the findings of the analysis, she will analyze Orlando's character based on his or her physical and mental condition. In this case, she will study what he/she does, says, thinks, or feels. In addition, she will as well learn about the typical characteristics of the Victorian age, since this century has a great effect upon Orlando's androgynous character and more particularly on her bisexual life.",
