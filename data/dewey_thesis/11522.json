  "title": "Robert Jordan's survival in Ernest Hemingway's for whom the bell tolls",
  "abstract": "The theme of bravery and cowardice, in addition to the idea of death and survival are marvelously developed throughout one of Ernest Hemingway?s works, For Whom the Bell Tolls. Robert Jordan as the main protagonist, during the analysis, is proven to be a character who insists on continuing to survive during the perilous circumstances. The issue of his endurance leads me to question the important reasons that motivate him to uphold his survival as well as another fascinating curiosity about what he performs to survive. In doing this study, I use characterization and conflict as the main tools to disclose Robert Jordan?s ways to survive and a supporting concept of motivation is also utilized especially to reveal Jordan?s reasons to uphold his survival. By applying those tools and theory in the analysis, I figure out that his causes to endure are his bravery in fighting against suicide and the dreams that occupy his mind. Furthermore, the ways that Jordan applies to survive are by giving war education and training to the guerilla and the gypsies and by being a rational person. At the end of the analysis, I wrap up that all action and attitude that Jordan performs lead him to survive.",
