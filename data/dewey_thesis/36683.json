  "title": "Promotional blogs for [NEW] Bold MUKU project",
  "abstract": "This project is creating promotional blogs for [NEW] Bold MUKU Project. It is inspired by the current situation when Indonesian teenagers have no big interest in reading books because of the digital media. In 2011, a book-sharing movement, Bold MUKU Project, tried to track back Indonesian teenagers’ reading interest and yet did not work successfully due to the unspecific target market, the lack of planning, sources, and member structuring. Therefore, in this project I would like to discover the promotional blogs that might interest the target audience. Hence, to answer this question, I will consider the result of the surveys and use the concepts of Internet consumer behavior and theory of copy writing by Rob Bowdery. The findings are the promotional blogs for [NEW] Bold MUKU Project, that is, the main blog and an Instagram account. These two promotional blogs are popular to promote products and services. The main blog provides information and discussion among the community. The second promotional blog is Instagram as a place to attract viewers to open the main blog. In conclusion, in order to have successful promotional blogs, the contents of the promotional blogs must fit to the target audience’s interests and needs.",
