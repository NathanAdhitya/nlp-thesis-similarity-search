  "title": "A Study of the causes and effects of marcopolo's pessimism in eugene o'neill's marco millions",
  "abstract": "This thesis is an analysis of pessimism in O'Neill's Marco Millions. It deals with the life of the main character, Marco Polo, in facing his conflicts. In the analysis, I am curious to know what the causes and effects of Marco Polo's pessimism are. In this analysis, I am going to use the concept of the term pessimism. Besides, I use literary theories, that is the theory of characterization and conflict as well as the psychological theory of defense mechanism. Through the analysis I find out that Marco's pessimism is caused by the disharmony between the ideal thought and the reality. Marco, who is romantic, idealistic, humane, and sociable, has to face that reality is not like what he thinks. The old values that he has already had before are crushed by the reality of being a merchant. Moreover, Marco is very naive in facing the reality. Therefore, he is shaken by the fact that people crush his values. He then turns to be a pessimistic person. Furthermore, he uses defense mechanism in order to overcome his conflicts.",
