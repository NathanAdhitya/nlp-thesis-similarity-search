  "abstract": "In this study, the writer analyzed the types of argument structure used by lawyers in Alan Shore and Lori Colson’s trials in their transcript in court and the reason of the predominant type that occurred. The theories used in this study are the theory of argument by Copi and Cohen (1990), and the theory of argument structure by Bierman and Assali (1996). The data are the arguments of lawyers in Alan Shore and Lori Colson’s trials which are used in the court room. They used a convergent structure the most (40%) which were followed by a mixed structure (33.33%), a serial structure (20%), and a linked structure (6.67%). The findings showed that the predominant type of structure is a convergent structure. They used a convergent structure the most because in a court room, the number of arguments that can substantiate is better and more convincing. Besides, more substantiate in one argument can help to convince the jury. Therefore, for convincing the jury and winning the case, lawyers use the convergent structure which consists of many supports for one argument.",
