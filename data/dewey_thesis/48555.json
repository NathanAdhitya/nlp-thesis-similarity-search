  "title": "Firm characteristics and CSR impact on risk in agriculture and mining industry in Indonesia",
  "abstract": "This study aims to determine Firm Characteristics' relationship to Firm Risk, with Corporate social responsibility (CSR) as an intervening variable. The Firm Characteristics include Leverage and Firm Size as an indicator, while Firm Risk is measured by total risk and asset return risk. Meanwhile, the CSR is measured with the Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co. (KLD) index. Seventeen companies from Agriculture and Mining industry in 5 years in Indonesia will be used as samples. By carrying out the Structural Equation Model (SEM), it was revealed that firm characteristics negatively affect Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The negative result was also obtained for the relationship between Firm factors to risk and CSR to risk.",
