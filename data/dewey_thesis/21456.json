  "title": "A Sociolinguistic study of the character development of Brutus in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar",
  "abstract": "Shakespeare's Julius Caesar is a story about Rome under Caesar's rule.Caesar's power makes some noblemen jealous of him.However,the writer does not discuss about Caesar.She is interested in Brutus'character since critics say that he is a static character.She wants to argue that he is a developing character.To prove her hypothesis,she uses the theory of Sociolinguistic. The theory of Sociolinguistic is to relate the language factors to see how one's character is.In Sociolinguistics,there is a relationship between the language factors and the social factors.The social factors affect the language factors which reflect to one's character.Therefore,the changes of the social factors can influence the changes of the language factors. Then,the changes of the language factors show that Brutus'character is changed.This also means that the relationship of the language factors and the social factors can prove the developing character of Brutus.",
