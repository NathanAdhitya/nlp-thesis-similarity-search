  "title": "A Study of the causes and effects of Sue's Guilty feeling as seen in Thomas Hardy's jude the obscure",
  "abstract": "This thesis primarily deals with Thomas Hardy?s work Jude the Obscure. The most striking point that I note in this novel is Sue?s guilty feeling. In relevance to this, I intend to discuss Sue?s guilty feeling, its causes and also effects to her life and other people around her. Therefore, this thesis is aimed to analyze the causes of Sue?s guilty feeling and also its effects to her life and other people. I use library and internet researches to get data for the analysis. In order to do the analysis, I use literary approach and as the tools I use the theories of characterization and conflict, and also the concept of guilty feeling. After doing the analysis of Jude the Obscure, I find out that the major cause of Sue?s guilty feeling is because she has disappointed Phillotson. After a tragedy comes into her life, her guilty feeling becomes more serious. I also find out that this guilty feeling affects her life very much. Sue becomes an over-sensitive woman that loses control easily. Furthermore, I find out that her guilty feeling also affects other people, namely her husband, Phillotson, and also her lover, Jude.",
