  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of the main male character's maturity in Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers. The thesis writer wants to find out what has caused the main male character to become mature and also she wants to know how it changes. She uses literary approaches for doing the analysis. She uses characterization and setting as the literary devices, and she will emphasize on Walder's criticism about the changes of the main character from innocence to maturity. She analyzes the main character's personalities in order to know the main character's character traits before and after he becomes mature. She also analyzes other supporting characters' influences, such as : Alfred Jingle, Sam Weller, and Mrs. Bardell. Besides, she also analyzes the condition of the Fleet Prison and how it influences Mr. Pickwick's maturity. Finally, from the analysis, the thesis writer concludes that experience whether it is good or bad may affect someone's attitude to become more mature.",
