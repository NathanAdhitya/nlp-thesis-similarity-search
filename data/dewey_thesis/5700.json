  "abstract": "Sydney Carton?s character in Charles Dickens? A Tale of Two Cities is a person who lives a wasted life as unpromising man. However, when he falls in love with Lucie Manette, it influences him and changes him to the better. First, I want to discuss how Sydney Carton?s character before he falls in love and how it changes his character. Next, I want to discuss about the problems in Sydney Carton?s life and how his love for Lucie Manette has changed him. I use literary approach like the theory of characterization and conflict to do the analysis. Falling in love has changed Sydney Carton?s character for the better. From a careless, uncaring and frustrated character, Sydney Carton has changed into a careful, caring and hopeful character. It is results from Sydney Carton?s falling in love with Lucie Manette that affects his point of view and he learns to overcome his problems in life. At the end, Sydney Carton changes so much that he is willing to sacrifice his life for the ones he loves.",
