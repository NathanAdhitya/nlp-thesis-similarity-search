  "title": "Job?s trials and resistances as revealed in the book of job",
  "abstract": "The Book of Job is one of poetic books in the Bible. This thesis is about Job?s trials and resistances as seen in some chapters of the Book of Job. In discussing how Job resists on the trials he has, the thesis writer uses literary approach with the theories of conflict and characterization as devices to analyze. As this book is a combination of prose and poetry, the theory of figurative language will also be used in the analysis to find out what the trials and resistances of Job are and how they are revealed. The thesis writer analyzes Job?s characterization and conflicts, and also the figures of speech used by all characters in the book to find out what Job?s trials are and the ways he resists the trials. The analysis itself is divided according to the trials and the ways Job resists the physical, psychological, social, and also spiritual trials. In the conclusion, the thesis writer finds out that Job resists on the trials because he does not realize that he has done sin before God. When the trials open his eyes to see his mistake, he humbly repents and continues worshipping God.",
