  "abstract": "This research discussed the use of high involvement style and high considerateness style in formal and informal small groups? discussions. Besides, the writer tried to find the influence of social factors in the different use of styles in the discussions. In informal meetings, the use of high involvement was higher than the high considerateness styles, while in formal meetings the use of high considerateness styles was higher than high involvement styles. The writer also found that each element of social factors such as participant, setting, topic, and function has a significant contribution to the use of different styles. The higher social power of the leader than the member may affect the use of high involvement style, and the equal social power among members of the group also may affect the use of high involvement style, but the lower social power of the member than the leader may affect the use of high considerateness style. The formality of the topic is very significant factor in the choice of style. Also, the different setting of place and different function of speech may affect the use of styles.",
