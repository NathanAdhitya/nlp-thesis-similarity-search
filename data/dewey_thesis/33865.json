  "abstract": "This project is a work for making a script for film, which I used for my final project. I believe that later, my screenplay can be played in cinemas. The project I used in my final project is screenplay writing. In my screenplay writing, I talk about a girl who lives in Java has to work in remote area in Papua Island. The screenplay writing which I used in my project, I used two types of theories. The theories that I used are culture shock and maturation. I use these two theories it is because in everyday life we experience with culture shock and maturation. The story in my screenplay writing is talking about a volunteer teacher who has to survive to teach the students in remote area who are very different with students in Java. Later, the audience will be showed the real situation in remote area. The conclusion is the audience will get the imagination of the real situation inn remote area and the experience happened by the main character. The story will be used as rel-life situation that happened in the real situation based on true story.",
