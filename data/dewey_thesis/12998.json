  "title": "A Study of the struggle for self-identity and self-esteem of the main female character as seen in Alica Walker's the color purple",
  "abstract": "The Color Purple is basically a study of the struggle for self-identity and self-esteem. Alice Walker's The Color Purple picturizes the main female character, Celie, as undergoing identity crisis and low self-esteem as a result of male sexist domination and oppression. Celie is visualized as a woman in weak position in which They provide emotional support to the main female character's struggle. As the result of the women friendship, Celie recovers from identity crisis and has higher self-esteem. Celie is also able to regain her identity as a woman and her self-esteem by establishing a business of designing and making pants. She can make her own living outside male domination. The transformation of Celie affects her oppressor in a way that the oppressor respects her more than ever. she could only accept the abuses and the oppressions stoically. This thesis examines how Celie struggles to construct her identity and self-esteem and how significantly the struggle affects Celie and her oppressor. In order to accomplish the analysis, the writer mostly bases her study on the theory of Black Feminism, that is, the theory of black-defined struggle through the character of Celie. Celie's personal transformation comes up with the help of the other female characters.",
