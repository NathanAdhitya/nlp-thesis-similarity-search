  "title": "The Study of Jim's language change in O'Neill's all God's chillun got wings",
  "abstract": "In Eugene 0' Neill's ul God's Chillun Got Jim Harris, the main character, seems to speak differently to his interlocutors. At the beginning of the play, he seems to use a lot of nonstandard English, while toward the end of it, he seems to employ a lot of standard English. Based on this, through sociolinguistic approach, firstly, the writer attempts to discover the factors that govern Jim's language change from nonstandard into standard English by analyzing Jim's language use during childhood and adulthood. Secondly, she aims to find out whether the language 0' Neill uses reinforces the idea of black equality that he is going to convey to his readers. And after doing the analysis, she discovers some factors that make Jim's language change, namely social ambition, educational level and degree of intimacy. In this way, she also finds out that in fact the language 0' Neill uses in this play reinforces the idea of black equality that he is going to convey.",
