  "title": "The Role of women as mothers in Harry Potter series",
  "abstract": "This study focuses on the role of female characters in Harry Potter series. It aims to find out whether the female characters in Harry Potter series take the mother role for Harry. Therefore, this study analyzes the motherly characteristics that the female characters, particularly Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood, in Harry Potter series have. The writer uses the theory on myth by Roland Barthes in analyzing the girlsâ€™ roles in the story. Through this analysis, the writer finds out that the female characters in Harry Potter series do possess motherly characteristics which are protective, nurturing, and educating. There are two myths that are intertwined, the myth that girls are supposed to be mothers and the myth that mothers are supposed to protect, nurture, and educate their children. Through these findings, it can be concluded that J.K. Rowling still cannot escape myths surrounding girls and women; she sees being a mother as the most powerful for girls and women.",
