  "title": "A Study of the character-development similarity and differences of uncle Daniel Ponder and Edna Earle in Endura Welty's Ponder Heart",
  "abstract": "This study discusses one of Eudora Welty?s novels entitled the Ponder Heart. This discussion talks about the similarity and differences of the main characters. The writer uses the literary theories, such as the theory of characterization and the theory of conflict. In the analysis, the writer finds out that Uncle Daniel Ponder, one of the main male characters, has similar background as Edna Earle, one of the main female characters: lack of love. Besides having a similar background, they have different characters. Uncle Daniel who can not develop his character because he is stupid and uneducated, is categorized as static character. Edna Earle, on the other hand, who develops herself, so that she has higher education and high intelligence, is categorized as dynamic character. However although they have differences, they still can live together. At last, the most important finding that the writer gets is that the dissimilarity is not the stumble stone to unify in one?s life.",
