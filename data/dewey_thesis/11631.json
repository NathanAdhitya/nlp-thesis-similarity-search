  "abstract": "In this study, the writer investigated the occurrence of the characteristics of pirate talk used by Jack Sparrow in Pirates of The Caribbean: At World?s End movie. The main theory used was taken from Choundas (2007). In her study, the writer used a descriptive qualitative approach which was supported with quantitative data. The data obtained was 137 expressions. The result of the analysis showed that the questions and replies had the highest frequency of occurrence with the percentage of 24% while oaths had the least frequency (1%). The writer also found that threats, curses and insults were not used by Sparrow. The use of these 13 characteristics might show that Sparrow was actually a ridiculous and funny pirate. The findings also showed that the use of words was very useful and even more powerful than any physical weapons.",
