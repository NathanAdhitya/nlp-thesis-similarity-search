  "title": "A Study of the causes and effects of Cressida's betrayal through the main characters and setting in Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida",
  "abstract": "This thesis is about the betrayal in Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida. To show the role of betrayal of Cressida, the writer analyzes the main characters named Troilus and Cressida, and Trojan War as the setting of Cressida*s betrayal in this analysis. Furthermore the betrayal, l and depression of the main characters are related to one another. In the discussion, the causes of Cressida's betrayal are divided into two; their different ideas about love is the major cause, and Trojan War is the setting of Cressida's betrayal to incite the realistic view of Cressida to betray Troilus. As a result, the betrayal brings great effects to Troilus and Cressida such as destruction and depression; their love is demolished, Troilus' idealism is destroyed, and they get great depression. Their misfortune comes to them and it brings them to tragedy.",
