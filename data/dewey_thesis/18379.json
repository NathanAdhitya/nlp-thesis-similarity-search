The writer also investigated the form of directive that occured the most frequently in both male and female chefs? registers along with their differences. The main theory used for this study was Holmes? (1992) theory of directives forms. The writer also used the theory of major types of clause proposed by Biber, Conrad, and Leech (2002) also the theory of gender differences in producing directives by Coates (2004) in supporting the analysis of the forms of directives of the chefs? speech. In her study, the writer used a descriptive approach which is supported by quantitative data. The result of the analysis showed that from a hundred and twenty five utterances taken from the male chef, the most frequently occurred form of directive is the declarative form. While the female chef produced directives utterances mostly in the form of imperatives. The writer also found that the female chef also produced their directives in the form of interrogative which did not occur in the male chef?s uttered registers. Also, there were differences of the form of imperatives produced by male and female chefs.",
