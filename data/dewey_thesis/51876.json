  "abstract": "I did my internship in CV. Nusantara. The service That CV. Nusantara provides construction on Infrastructure. The company takes jobs from the government. So, the customers for the company are the government itself. And our competitors are CV. Wahana Konstruks and PT. Kayan Jaya. The main problem in the company is that the company only takes jobs from the government. However, since 2019 the company has been suspended to participate in any goverment project contract. My solution was to make a website for the company. The website consists of six pages, such as Tentang Kami, Cara Menghubungi Kami, Tim Kami, Keahlian Kami, pekerjaan yang pernah dikerjakan, and Informasi Lebih lanjut. Websites are the right tools because the new target market can see the information that they need. In addition, websites could also help the company to reach their target market. The theories that I am going to used is Brand and brand awareness, Marketing, Website, and USP.",
