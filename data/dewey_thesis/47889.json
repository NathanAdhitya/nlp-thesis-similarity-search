  "abstract": "Employee retention demonstrates the company's ability to keep on giving incentives for talented employees to stay within the company. In the last few years, the company is having difficulties in retaining qualified employees. These difficulties in retaining gifted employees could then lead to a high employee turnover rate. Thus, the purpose of this research is to develop a strategy as to how L.G. Electronics Benelux B.V. can retain talented/high potential/high-performing employees for a more extended period. This research paper's analysis is conducted based on the literature review that has been driven by the writer. Moreover, interviews have been conducted with the H.R. Business Partner to get the employer's perspective regarding employee retention and the employees to get the employees' perspective. Furthermore, the result of the interviews will be for the writer to devise the recommendations as to how the company can retain talented employees for a more extended period. With that being said, the research, interviews, and analysis have all been conducted very well and have produced a total of eight recommendations based on different aspects of employee retention to improve the company's employee retention policy ultimately.",
