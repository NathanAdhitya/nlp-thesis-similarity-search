  "title": "A Stylistic study on the sweet 17th birthday invitation cards designed by Sayogo Enterprises",
  "abstract": "In this study, the writer tries to find out what kind of language style used in the sweet 17th birthday invitation cards designed by Sayogo Enterprises. The data are taken from 12 invitation cards. For this study, the writer uses Keraf?s theory of language styles. From linguistics aspect, there are four kinds of language style; language style based on diction, tone, meaning, and sentence structure. Yet, to analyze the invitation cards, the writer only uses two out of the four language styles: those based on meaning and based on sentence structure. There are two questions used to guidance this study. The first is what language style based on meaning mostly used in all invitation cards. The second is what language style based on sentences structure mostly used in all invitation cards. From the analysis of language style based on meaning, the writer finds out that there are 6 styles used, 3 from rhetorical style and 3 from metaphorical style. The rhetorical styles are hyperbole, chiasmus and rhetorical question, while metaphor, personification and irony are the styles from metaphorical style. In addition, hyperbole and metaphor are used in all invitations. Yet, metaphor is the most often used. Anti-climax and climax are the two styles from analysis of language based on sentence structure. Moreover, climax is most often used.",
