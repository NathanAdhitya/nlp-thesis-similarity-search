  "abstract": "The present study was conducted to find out what kinds of swear words were used and most occurred on Jackass: the Movie. The study was also aimed to investigate why the actors of the movie expressed the swear words, and which reason occurred the most. The writer used the theories proposed by Liedlich (1973) as his main review of related literature. This research was a descriptive research. The writer got the data from 57 scenes in the movie. He transcribed the conversations among the actors. Then he classified the swear words. Finally, he analyzed and calculated the data to identify and answer his research questions. The findings show that the actors use eight categories of swear words, namely copulative, human genital, Christ?s word, excretory, death, sexual irregularities, plant and animal term. The category mostly used by the actors is the copulative term. The actors used only one reason to swear, namely expressing emotions. The actors used expressing emotions as the only reason of swearing.",
