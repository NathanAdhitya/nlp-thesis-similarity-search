  "abstract": "This Thesis is a study on father's treatments toward Ernest, the main character in Butler's The Way of all Flesh. The thesis writer analysis the father~s treatments and their effects toward Ernest that lead him to search his independence. She uses characterization and psychological theory on child rearing in her analysis. She finds out that Ernest's depression and his decision to free himself are the result of his father's treatments. He endures his father's treatments that are unbearable for him. Therefore, he forces himself to search for his independence. Independence here means that he is free from his father. His father's treatment encourages him to cut off his parental relationship. Since then, he can decide his own life without being interfered by his father anymore. Ernest becomes a successful writer and leads a happy life",
