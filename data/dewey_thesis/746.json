  "title": "A Speech act analysis on the miscommunication between Ben and Katie Jordan in 'The Story of Us'",
  "abstract": "In communication, sometimes people have miscommunication. It happens because the hearer does not know what the speaker expects. The researcher is interested in analyzing speech acts, especially in the illocution and the perlocution and also the factors of miscommunication. In the data, the writer chose \"The Story of Us\" because there are many incidents of miscommunication, especially between the husband and the wife. For the theory, she used the Speech-Acts theory from Hurford and Heasley. In collecting the data, the writer transcribed the film then she classified and identified the illocution and the perlocution of the utterances. In analysis, the researcher found out that the area which causes miscommunication the most is in Giving (More) Explanation, Asking the Hearer to do Something, Giving Suggestion, and Criticizing. As the conclusion, the writer concluded that people could minimize miscommunication in their relationship if they understand the expectation of the speaker.",
