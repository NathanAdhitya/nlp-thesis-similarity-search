  "abstract": "In this study, by using the destination brand benefit pyramid and semiotics theories, the writer aimed to analyze the destination branding of Indonesia’s Tourism promotion through semiotics analysis in its visual and verbal expressions of video Wonderful Indonesia 2018 ‘The More You Feel The More You Know’. In this video, Indonesia’s tourism 2018 is highlighting three main destinations: East Nusa Tenggara, Bali and Yogyakarta. The writer also analyzed the rational benefits, emotional benefits, destination brand values (personality) and the brand essence of Indonesia’s tourism: Wonderful Indonesia. The writer uses qualitative content analysis as an approach to study. As the conclusion, the writer found that visiting Indonesia as the biggest archipelago of the world is more than just a leisure activity, but is about a journey to discover and to feel the real essence of Indonesia - a beautiful country, not only because of its natural wonders that exist nowhere else in the world but also because of the cultural traditions that are full of moral values which are inherited and ingrained from generation to generation as the identity as well as the characters of Indonesian people.",
