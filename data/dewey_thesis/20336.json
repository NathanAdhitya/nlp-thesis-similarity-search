  "abstract": "O 'Neill's Desire Under the Elms is the potraya of 0 Neill himself. O 'Neill uses the character of Eben to represent him . This thesis deals with human behavior . Eben tries to get the meaning of life by using his three faces of human behavlors, namely Parent, Adult. and Child ego states. Through sociolinguistic and psyehological approaches, the writer finds that Eben 's language reflects the ohange of his behaviors.

Eben 's behavior is reflected in his use of language. In stage one, tgot and three, Eben 's behavior is coveryd by his emotlonal feelings for he has Parent and Chlld ego states, but at last, in stage four his language changes again. He is polite and rational, for this time he has the Adult ego state.",
