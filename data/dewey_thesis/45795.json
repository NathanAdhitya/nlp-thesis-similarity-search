  "title": "The influence of e-WOM towards consumer’s intention in visiting particular restaurant: case study on consumers in greater Jabodetabek area",
  "abstract": "In the past years, the restaurant business in Jakarta has proliferated, also considered as a business with a high failure rate. The phenomenon of e-WOM (electronic word-of-mouth) is argued to be able to save the restaurant business from failure. e-WOM is seen as more credible and persuasive to influence people’s purchase intention because it came from consumers. Therefore, this research is done to accomplish an objective to analyze and identify which factors of e-WOM are significant in driving the influence for consumers to visit a particular restaurant. One hundred five respondents in Greater Jakarta Area were recruited to participate in the survey to fulfil this research. The data obtained is analyzed using Multiple Linear Regression analysis. From the study, it is found that among perceived credibility, positive e-WOM, negative e-WOM, user’s expertise, and e-WOM user’s involvement, only two factors which are positive e-WOM and e-WOM user’s participation are significant in influencing consumer’s intention to visit a restaurant after reading online restaurant reviews.",
