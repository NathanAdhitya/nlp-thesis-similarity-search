  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of pre-sequence expressions, utterances uttered by the speaker as a signal to the hearer before the speaker goes to the main idea. Pre-sequence is usually used before announcing, requesting, inviting, arranging, and closing something. The writer is interested in doing an analysis on pre-sequence in \"10 Things I Hate About You\" film. The two characters in the film, Patrick and Kat, use many pre-sequences to each other to be indirect. Thus, the writer wants to know the different preferences in the use of pre-sequence expressions based on gender in the film. In conducting the analysis, she uses Levinson?s (1984) theory of Pre-sequence. As a result, the writer finds that Pre-announcement is used the most for both of them. It is because they are not confident enough to approach each other. The writer also finds that in this film, Patrick uses more pre-sequence rather than Kat does. For Patrick, pre-announcement is the mostly used, the second is pre-request, the third is pre-arrangement, the fourth is pre-closing, and the least is pre-invitation. While for Kat, pre-announcement is also the mostly used, the second is pre-closing, the third is pre-request, the fourth is pre-invitation, and none of them is pre-invitation.",
