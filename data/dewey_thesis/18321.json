  "title": "Joe Pitt's identities in Tony Kushner's Angels in America: a gay fantasia on national themes",
  "abstract": "Joseph Porter Pitt is one of the five main characters in Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes that shows the most transformation: from being in a heterosexual relationship to a homosexual relationship. I emphasize my research on the how Joe?s identity as a homosexual is constructed and what his motivations are behind his attempts in re-embracing heterosexuality. To answer my inquiries, I use the concept of Stuart Hall?s identity and the concept of Dominance and Subordinacy since the former is most suitable to observe the construction of one?s identity and the latter most appropriate to understand the order of dominance and subordinancy. In the study, I discover that the construction of Joe?s homosexual identity is influenced by three aspects found in Part One: Millennium Approaches, the heterosexual and homosexual stereotyping, Louis? and Harper?s narration and Joe re-identification. In addition, I also find out that Joe?s re-embrace of the dominant?s lifestyle is motivated by the two advantages he gets as a closeted homosexual living a heterosexual life. Furthermore, at the end of my study, I find that Joe?s attempts lead to the abandonment by both Roy and Harper who both act as the representation of the dominant group.",
