  "title": "Selena: a screenplay exploring adult women's body image issue",
  "abstract": "Body image dissatisfaction is a widely universal problem that a lot of women can relate to. However, in the eyes of the media, much of the issue’s focus is centered around younger women’s point of view. This makes for a lack of perspectives, as women from any ages are never exempt from feeling discomfort within their bodies. This creative work intends to explore the struggles that adult women face when it comes to body image. It wants to explore how it can come about, how it affects them, and how they overcome it. It is written in the form of screenplay and is guided by E. Tory Higgins’s Self-Discrepancy Theory. The protagonist’s insecurities stem from actual/ideal discrepancy, and it causes her to feel dejected emotions that leads to lower self-esteem and depressive tendencies, which leads to unhealthy eating patterns, being absent in her personal life, and the struggle to perform well professionally. Eventually, she learns to minimize her discrepancy by learning how to favor her current attributes more and give more attention to other important aspects of her life. The film is emotional with a dash of magic in it, so it falls under the drama and low fantasy genre.",
