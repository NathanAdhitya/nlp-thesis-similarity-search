The high proficient learners represented by students who have an average of very good grade (â‰¥B+) in all language skill courses offered. The data was taken by conducting interview to each of learners based on Oxford (2011) theory. The findings showed all types of cognitive strategies are used by the high proficient learners.

Besides, there were a lot of varieties of the specific techniques employed by the participants. The most common specific techniques used were guessing, watching English speaking films, skimming, comparing English to mother tongue, reading novels and magazine, and brainstorming. To conclude, all proficient learners use all cognitive strategies but they might employ different techniques in their learning process.",
