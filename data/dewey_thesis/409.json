  "abstract": "\"To a Young Beauty\", \"On Woman\", \"Michael Robartes and the Dancer\" ,and \"A Prayer for my Daughter\" are Yeats?s four poems which are chosen by the thesis witer to be analyzed in this thesis. Generally, these four poems talk about Yeats`s expectations toward women, which then becomes one of the problems discussed in the thesis. To find the expectations, the thesis writer uses literary approach, and the literary theories needed to analyze the poems are the elements of poetry such as allusion, diction, imagery and figurative language that is symbol, metaphor, simile, personification, paradox and metonymy. The other problem discussed is the conformity of Yeats?s expectations with the Victorian society`s. To discuss this, the thesis writer needs the information about Victorian women. As the findings, the thesis writer sees that Yeats expects women to be beautiful; lady-like, which requires courtesy such as being kind; innocent and submissive to men. In addition, women also have to pay attention on their physical appearance and not to their intellectuality. Moreover, the thesis writer also finds out that two of Yeats?s expectations do not conform with the Victorian society?s.",
