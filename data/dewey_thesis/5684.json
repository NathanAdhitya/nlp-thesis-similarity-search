  "title": "A Study of human's depravation as seen through the human and the robots characters in 'Robbie', 'Runaround' and 'Reason' written in I,Robot by Isaac Asimov",
  "abstract": "This thesis discusses the three short stories in the book `I,Robot? . Each of the stories shows how the three laws of robotics apply to different robots and different situations. Each of the stories also shows how the robots take and interpret these three laws differently from the humans beings. As a result, some conflicts between the human and the robots begin. This makes the humans be deprived in term of their authority. It is clear that in the stories, the three laws of robotics are not enough to prevent the catastrophic consequences that lead the humans to depravation. In this thesis the writer is curious to find out in what way the human and robot characters in the three short stories show human?s depravation. In the analysis the writer uses a literary approach that is structuralism, especially binary opposition. By applying the binary opposition theory, the writer is able to find the insightful meaning which show and prove in what ways the human?s depravation occur in each of the stories.",
