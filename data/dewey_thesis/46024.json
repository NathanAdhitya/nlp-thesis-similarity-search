  "abstract": "In this internet era, it is very common for people to buy goods online, unexceptionally buying tickets via the website. In the case of online travel agencies, the big players cover almost the whole market. Those big players are Traveloka and Ticket.com. This research will benefit three parties, which are researchers or academicians, online travel agents, and entrepreneurs. The objective of the research is to analyze the influence of perceived web quality, trust, perceived value, and switching cost towards e-customer loyalty. It is done by gathering 122 data from questionnaires, which are distributed through Google form. Then, the writers use simple random sampling technique. Finally, the writers analyze the data gathered by using multiple linear regression methods. The result shows how perceived web quality, trust, perceived value, and switching significant cost impact the e-customer loyalty in the case of Traveloka. The results of this research show that trust and switching cost has a significant impact on e-customer loyalty. In contrast, perceived web quality and perceived value do not have a significant effect on e-customer loyalty.",
