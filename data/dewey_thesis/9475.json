  "abstract": "The thesis analyzes the Matilda?s failure to make relationship with men in the novel Cranford. The thesis writer would like dig out the cause that make Matilda fails in making the relationships with men. Furthermore, the thesis writer is interested in discussing how Matilda copes with the failure she has. In conducting the analysis, the thesis writer limits the analysis on Matilda Jenkyns as the main character. For this purpose, the thesis writer uses literary approach and uses characterization and conflict by Laurence Perrine. By applying those theories, the thesis writer is able to find out that the major causes of Matilda?s failure are the code of gentility in the society of Cranford, the dominant sister, the authoritative father, Matilda?s lack of confidence and Matilda?s fear to be rejected by her father and sister. Finally, the thesis writer is able to reveal how Matilda Jenkyns copes with the failure she has; those are by surrendering her life to God and opening a teashop with the help of her friends.",
