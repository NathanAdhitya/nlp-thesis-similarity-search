  "abstract": "This study aims to find out the language features used by Jerry Lorenzo and Kim Kardashian in The Mavericks with Mav Carter Podcast and the differences and similarities of the language features used. For this study, the writer used Lakoff’s (2004) and Coates’ (2013) language features theory. This study was done using a qualitative approach in which the writer transcribed and analyzed all of Jerry’s and Kim’s utterances which contain language features. The findings show that there are four differences in swear words, commands and directives, questions, and compliments. Moreover, there are nine similarities in color terms, adjectives, hedges, tag questions, intonations, intensifiers, grammar, politeness, and minimal responses. Based on the findings of Jerry’s and Kim’s language features, it can be concluded that there are no significant differences between the language features of women and men. The language features found were influenced by the context and topic of the conversation, and cultural changes in society instead of gender. Studies related to other factors affecting language features, such as ethnicity and status, are recommended to provide further understanding of language features.",
