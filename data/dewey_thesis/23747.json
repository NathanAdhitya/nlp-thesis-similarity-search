  "title": "The Idea of feminism in Trollope's Barchester Towers as reflected through his female characters",
  "abstract": "In Anthony Trollope?s Barchester Towers, women are very dominant in the story. Besides that, they are also different from the woman at the Victorian period at that time. That is why, the writer of this thesis tries to show how far the domination of the female characters through the prominent characters, Mrs. Proudie, Charlotte Stanhope and Eleanor Bold. Then, she also tries to find out wheter the domination shows the idea of feminism. Through the topic presented in this thesis, the writer wants to convey the idea of feminism in the nineteenth century, and the society?s opinion about women at Victorian period. By discussing about the society?s opinion on the women at the Victorian period, the writer shows that Trollope?s female characters are different from the Victorian lady at most for they express the idea of feminism. Finally, this thesis also analyzes the society?s reaction of feminism toward the female characters. Moreover, the idea cannot last long because it is attacked by males as seen in the discussion.",
