  "title": "The Sociological aspects of Pearl Buck's \"The Good Earth\"",
  "abstract": "In reading a novel, readers may find that it tells about the social life of a certain place in a certain time. The readers then will be able to enjoy the literary work and to observe the social life of the people in the novel. This study attempts to see the sociological aspect of \"The Good Earthtt, i.e. the lifestyle of a society as a whole in traditional China. We find that in traditional China there is a social stratification (the upper - the lower class, the rich - the poor) that affects the behaviour of people in their social relationship. Eight interpersonal relationships with their own problems are discussed. Five of them are primary relationships which tell about the relationships within the family. The rest are secondary relationships, which describe the relationships among the out-groups. These relationships are affected by the traditional rules the purpose of which is to make an orderly society that can control people's behaviour. This code shows that the culture is based on three ideologies, i . e . Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism.",
