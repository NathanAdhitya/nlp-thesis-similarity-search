  "abstract": "The study of women's quest to gain respect in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Emma is intended to analyze the effort of her heroines Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice and Emma Woodhouse in to gain respect in society. Elizabeth and Emma are different characters from other girls at that time. This does not mean that they are strange and odd, but they have special characteristics that can impress people. They are intelligent and smart, and have strict principles, high initiative, that is why people in their society respect them. In addition by studying Jane Austen's heroines, Elizabeth and Emma, the writer can reduce the society's assumptions that women are weak, unintelligent, and lack of initiative.",
