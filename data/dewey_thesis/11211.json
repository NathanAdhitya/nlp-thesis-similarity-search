  "abstract": "This thesis is about how to make a better HACCP system in the Golden River Restaurant which is located in Laren, Netherlands. Food safety and food hygiene is very important things for restaurant businesses, especially in The Netherlands. The purpose of this thesis is to give information in order to increase the hygiene in the Golden River Restaurant. In this thesis, the writers decided to take a qualitative research and the data is being collected from both interviews and direct observation during the one year traineeship here in The Netherlands. The writers did the interviews with the restaurant owner, the kitchen chef, and the kitchen supervisor. So the writers know how far the HACCP in the Golden River Restaurant is. The results of this thesis might be surprisingly for the readers because the writers found that the hygiene in the Golden River Restaurant is not very good at the moment. This is the first thesis about HACCP in Golden River Restaurant. So, further research is highly recommended to give more information about how to improve the HACCP in this restaurant. Because applying HACCP is not an instant work, it needs to be done step by step. This thesis also became the starting point to doing the next step in further research.",
