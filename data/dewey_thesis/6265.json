  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to reveal the idea of the way the notion of social status affects the maidservants?s choice of terms of address. The writer uses qualitative descriptive approach in doing her research. She did the observation by joining the conversation as participant. Then, the writer observed and wrote down on the terms of address the informants used in the conversation. There were two informants who came from Semarang and Banyuwangi. The theories followed are definition of terms of address by Janet Holmes and Kridalaksana, and the theories of the use of terms of address by Janet Holmes, Wardhaugh, Brown and Gilman, Beals, and Cliffort Geertz.. From the data gathered, the writer found out that the terms of address used to address older interlocutors are bapak, ibu, pak, bu, budhe, mbah, pak Dodik, sampeyan, and zero term. To address same age interlocutors, the respondents use pak, mas, mbak, bu Dodik, bu Subur, mbak Okie, njenengan, sampeyan, and zero term. And to address younger interlocutors, they use mas, mbak, dik, mbak Via, mbak Okie, mbak Nonon, mas Tantyo, dik Yogi, Tantyo, Yogi, kamu, sampeyan, kowe, and zero term. However, some of the use of kinship terms tend to indicate social status and rather than biological age, especially in addressing younger interlocutors of higher social status.",
