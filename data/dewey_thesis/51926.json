  "title": "The creation of commodified identity: the rise of TikTok influencer",
  "abstract": "The rise of digital communication and technology in recent years has led to the transition of SNS platforms from communication to community, lifestyle, and to a commodification. This study explores the means upon which TikTokers’ virtual personas were commodified. Therefore, I aim to address these two research questions: (1) What are the distinct images and motives represented by the two TikTok influencers? (2) How are the virtual personas of the two influencers commodified digitally on TikTok?. In addressing these questions, I conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with two TikTok influencers. This study employs narrative inquiry and the reading of Uses and Gratification Theory (UGT), Goffman’s dramaturgy, and Cote’s identity capital to examine the motives underlying the creation of their TikTok personas and how these led to the commodification of their TikTok personas. This study reveals that the two informants crafted their TikTok personas based on the concept of authenticity and quirkiness following the roles the two were playing as Istri dan Mama-Mama Muda and Koko Kuliner. The study concludes that there is a complex relation between the carefully crafted self-images and aspects of identity capital to elevate individuals’ identity to the point that it reflects identity as a saleable image which circulates meaning and material profits.",
