  "abstract": "The writer of this thesis writes about Mowgli's process of searching his own identity in Rudyard Kipling's The jungle Books. Rudyard Kipling's The Tungle Books contains several stories about the jungle inhabitants in the Wainganga's riverbank, but most of the stories relate to an Indian's boy, Mowgli. Mowgli is a boy who is raised by the jungle's beast in the Wainganga's riverbank. He grows up among the jungle's beasts and fights to survive against the harsh of jungle nature and his enemy Shere-Khan. This character also must pass through conflicts against himself and his own kinds until he finally learns to accept his true identity as a human being. In analyzing Mowgli's story the thesis writer uses theory of character and conflict, which are applied as literary approach, he also uses theory of self-identity and theory of relation between self-identity with social-group as supporting data in order to support his analysis. Besides that, the purpose of writing this thesis is to reveal the main character's development in finding his own identity and also to reveal his obstacles and his supports in finding his own identity.",
