  "abstract": "Sexual coercion or violence is much more likely to be used by men than women (Lips 145). Yet, the poem Venus and Adonis, presents it contradictorily. Venus and Adonis is the first poem by Shakespeare which he calls \"the first heir of ray invention\". Believing that Shakespeare is one of the greatest playwright and poet as well, I gladly choose him and his poem Venus and Adonis to become the subject of my thesis. The way Shakespeare portraits a goddess through Venus as the doer of seduction attracts my highest attention to analyze the factors that make Venus try to seduce Adonis. Moreover, I also curious to know what factors make Adonis refuses Venus' seduction since it is uncommon for men not to be interested in sexual relationships. With the use of literary devices such as figures of speech, imagery and symbolism, I try to analyze the factors of Venus' efforts to seduce Adonis and Adonis' to refuse her. Through beautiful languages, Shakespeare successfully dramatizes seduction as a significant matter to be considered. In the poem, I figures out the external and internal factors that make someone commit seduction and refuse seduction. This will lead readers to become aware of the danger of seduction and to be able of controlling passion.",
