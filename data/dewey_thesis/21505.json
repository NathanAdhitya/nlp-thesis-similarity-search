  "title": "The Study of Barbara's language as reflection of her changing attitude in Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara",
  "abstract": "In Bernard Shaw's, Major Barbara, Barbara has undergone an attitude change. In the beginning of the play, she belongs to the Salvation Army and she is a Major there who brings salvation to the poor. Later on, she changes, for joining her father's ( Undershaft's ) company, which at first she identified it as the factory of death and she is no longer a Major in the Salvation Army. The writer wants to know whether Barbara's language also changes as her attitude changes since there is a relationship between language and behavior. Applying Lexical Stylistics and other branches of linguistics, the writer tries to find the answer. Thus, through the use of keywords, she will get the comparison of frequencies of Barbara's words selection in the form of lexical items before and after she changes her attitude. If there are differences in the total frequencies at the same keyword, then Barbara's language used is concluded changes as her attitude changes. The analysis shows that there are differences between them.",
