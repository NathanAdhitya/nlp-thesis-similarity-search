  "title": "Main male characters and their reactions to her attitudes in Charles Dicken's the mistery of Edwin Drood",
  "abstract": "The thesis writer is interested in discussing what Rosa Bud's attitudes are toward the four main male characters: Edwin Drood, John Jasper, Neville Landless, and Lieutenant Tartar in Dickens' The Mystery of Edwin Drood and how the four main male characters react to her attitudes. The writer will analyze how Rosa Bud's attitudes bring some changes on the 'four main male characters' lives. In analyzing the topic above, the writer uses the theory of characterization to reveal Rosa Bud's attitudes toward the four main male characters. Rosa Bud's attitudes lead to their reactions either good or bad that cause some changes to their lives. At last, the thesis writer concludes that Rosa Bud is a strong character so that the four main male characters are interested in her and even Edwin Drood, Neville Landless, and John Jasper have to face tragic lives because of her attitudes toward them.",
