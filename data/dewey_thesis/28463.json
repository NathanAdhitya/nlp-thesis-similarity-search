  "title": "The Struggle for getting acknowledgement in Luigi Pirandello's play Six Characters in Search of an Author",
  "abstract": "Six Character in Search of an Author is a play by Luigi Pirandello which tells about a group of characters who is in searching for an author. Thus, through this thesis, I analyze the ways that the father and the step-daughter do in struggling for their meaning of life. To analyze how they will get their meaning of life, I use the theory of existentialism because it is the most appropriate theory that can help me show the ways of The father and The Step-daughter struggle for their meaning of life. However, through this analysis, I finally find out the ways The Father and The Step-daughter do to get their meaning of life that is by getting acknowledgement from others. They have different way to get their meaning of life such as by creating a relation with THE MANAGER, by showing The Father’s uniqueness and by using The Step-daughter’s past memory.",
