  "abstract": "The Turn of the Screw is a novelette which has three possible themes according to literary critics.Two themes oppose each other and the other one suggests that many themes are possible including both themes.The writer,applying Lexical Stylistics,other linguistic studies and also liter - ary theories,tries to find out the most dominant theme of the novel.The analysis is based on the elements which constitute the themes,that is,the motifs in the form of lexical items.The most dominant theme has the most recur - ring motifs and the analysis shows that theme one is the most dominant one among the three dominant themes.By finding out the most dominant theme of the story,the ambigu - ity in the theme of the novel has been solved.",
