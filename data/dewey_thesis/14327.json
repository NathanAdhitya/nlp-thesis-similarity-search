  "title": "The Achievement of justice by Meg Merrilies and Paulus Pleydell in Sir Walter Scott's guy mannering",
  "abstract": "The novel, Guy Mannering, reflects a universal urge for law and justice. The main focus of the writer's analysis of this novel is on the restoration of a lost heir to his identity and property by the main characters, Meg Merrilies and Paulus Pleydell. The heir's rights have been seized since his childhood by a bad lawyer, Gilbert Glossin. He even tries to kill the heir in order to fulfil his ambition, that is pursuing the heir's estate. However, through the hands of Meg Merrilies and Paulus Pleydell, the lost heir finally is able to get his rights back. The thesis writer is curious to know why Meg Merrilies and Paulus Pleydell want to achieve justice for the lost heir. The discussion of this thesis begins with the description of Meg Merrilies' and Paulus Pleydell's character traits, proceeds to the motivation that lead them to decide to help the lost heir, and ends with their efforts in achieving justice which shows that they are really the champions of justice. Meg Merrilies' sacrifice in restoring the heir's true identity and Paulus Pleydell's ambition in solving the heir's problems makes the thesis writer conclude that their good character traits have the greatest influence in their achievement of justice for the lost heir as the rightful heir.",
