  "abstract": "This thesis entitled A Study of Janie 's Accomplishment of Self-Understanding in Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God uncovers the Afro-American female main character's life in searching for her self-understanding. The author of the novel aims to show that being black and a woman is not disgraceful and spiteful, but it is wonderfully gifted by God. Hurston's aim is rendered in Janie Mae Crawford who seeks her self-understanding through love. This thesis examines how Janie gains her voice through her two unsuccessful marriages which, at the end, leads to the accomplishment of self-understanding. Such an accomplishment is helped by the existence of true love between Janie and Tea Cake. In other words, love flourishes the growth of Janie's self. Significantly, the thesis writer applies the theories included in the Afro-American oral tradition, such as the use of unique metaphors and the Signifyin(g) Monkey to achieve the in-depth analysis. Mastering the use of metaphors and the Signifyin(g) Monkey together with the help of love makes Janie accomplish her self-understanding. From male-identified woman, Janie develops into the self-identified woman. Additionally, she becomes the role model in the society.",
