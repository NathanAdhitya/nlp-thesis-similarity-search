  "title": "Contemporary Chinese Indonesian weddings",
  "abstract": "Everyone has their own culture that is being passed down from generation to generation. In every culture, there is one tradition that is important, which is weddings. Weddings are important for Chinese Indonesians because it is considered their rites of passage. But because of the flow of globalization, a lot of young Chinese Indonesians who lack knowledge of their Chinese tradition tend to follow the Western wedding tradition as the new and more modern wedding tradition. Therefore, Chinese Indonesians are finding a new way to convey their cultural Identity as Chinese and modern by using Chinese and Western wedding traditions. This thesis aims to find out the Western cultural elements that are commonly used in Chinese Indonesian weddings and why they use them. The Western cultural elements that are commonly used in Chinese Indonesian weddings can be seen in the rituals, attire, decoration, and also cutlery. The data that is used in this thesis is based on previous research about Western and Chinese weddings. Interviews are also conducted to support the statement that I stated in this paper. From this thesis, the Chinese Indonesians that perform their wedding with the Western and Chinese wedding traditions create a new identity culture. A hybrid culture exists from this new cultural identity as contemporary or modern Chinese.",
