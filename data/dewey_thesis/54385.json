  "abstract": "Hikikomori is a severe form of social withdrawal, with more cases being reported over the past few years. This phenomenon is more relevant than ever, caused by the increasing expectation from the environment and the overwhelming responsibility being put to someone whoâ€™s not ready to tackle everything at once. Diving deep into the psyche and their perspective of the world, showing the audience that this could happen to us, and whether or not we can get out from this endless slump or succumb to depression. This project focuses for the audience to think about the deeper meaning, and look back whether or not things such as responsibility, and social expectations affects their mental health.",
