  "title": "A Study of Molly Gibson's maturation as seen in Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives and Daughter",
  "abstract": "The thesis writer discusses the process of the main female?s development from immaturity to maturity in Elizabeth Gaskell?s Wives and Daughters. Utilizing the literary approach, the thesis writer analyzes Elizabeth Gaskell?s Wives and Daughters by applying literary theories such as characterization and conflict. Besides, she needs the definition of maturity as the supporting tool. The thesis writer wonders what makes Molly Gibson, the main female character undergo the process of maturation and how the process transforms her. The analysis shows that in the process to be mature the main female character undergoes a crisis, which only Roger Hamley?s advice could influence her so that she can face the crisis and come to maturation. The change experienced by Molly Gibson from immaturity to maturity is for the better of everything. Undoubtedly the change eventually makes the main female character become a better person and the change brings love as the result since she deserves it.",
