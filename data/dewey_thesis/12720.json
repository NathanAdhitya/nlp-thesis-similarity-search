  "title": "A Study of George Brush's failure in Wilder's heaven's my destination",
  "abstract": "The Study on Wilder's Heaven's My Destination is intended to analyze Brush's characters trait and behavior which lead him to his failure to stand on his principle and faith. From the discussion, it is revealed that George Brush is the victim of his own ambition to live a clean life. He really wants to live totally based on the Bible. Unfortunately he cannot absorb the idea of it. Obsessed by his ambition to live a clean life, Brush always wants to perform goodwill for others. He merely applies his principle to all people. Morever, he does not know that goodness is not always the same for everyone. What someone thinks as a good thing, on the contrary, it may be bad or even disgusting for others. Due to such attitude, his surrounding people turn to hate, ignore, and look down on him. Finally, it is found out that Brush fails in defending his principle and faith. As a conclusion, it can be said that Brush's characters trait is the most important reason for his failure to stand on his principle.",
