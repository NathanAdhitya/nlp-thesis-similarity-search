  "title": "A Text analysis of job vacancy advertisements in The Jakarta Post",
  "abstract": "This is a study about text structure in job vacancy genre. The writer observes job vacancy advertisements taken from the Jakarta Post on February 2008, Saturday edition. The data is analyzed by using text structure theory proposed by Halliday and Hasan (1989). The writer finds that the texts which have been analyzed have different actual structures. However, all of the texts share some obligatory elements such as CN, P, RQ, AP and CA. In addition, after comparing the actual structures of every text, the writer concludes that the GSP of job vacancy advertisements in the Jakarta Post is [(AI)^]CN.^(S.)^(CpD.)^P.^[(L.)^(PD.)^(JD.)^RQ.^(SD.)^(WP.)^][(F.)^ AP.^] [(CD.)^(PP.)^CA.]^(SN.)^(FI.) Furthermore, the optional elements in job vacancy advertisements are AI, S, CpD, L, PD, JD, SD, WP, F, CD, PP, SN and FI while the iterative elements are P, RQ, and WP.",
