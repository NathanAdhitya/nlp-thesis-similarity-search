  "abstract": "A Man for All Seasons, a play by Robert Bolt tries to reveal the life of Sir Thomas More, one of the famous chancellors in the history of England and a true catholic. In this thesis, I analyze the main character?s loyalty to his king and to his faith. That is why I am curious to find out how Sir Thomas More is loyal to his king and to his faith and what are the consequences of Sir Thomas More?s loyalty. The purpose of my thesis is to reveal Sir Thomas More?s loyalty to his king and his faith and its consequences. In order to analyze it I use literary approach which is the theory of characterization and conflict as the literary devices. In the end of my analysis, I find out that the main character keeps his loyalty to his king and to his faith because he is the king?s chancellor and a good catholic since it is his duty and obligation to his king and to his faith. He has to accept the death penalty as a final consequence of his loyalty to his king and his faith. As a conclusion, his loyalty to his king and his faith has helped him to teach others for keeping their own conscience.",
