  "abstract": "In indirect advertising, an advertisement does not boldly show the products on the video. The object in this thesis is a video advertisement of a clothing line, H&M, consisting of a story about a family in the holiday season. This thesis aims to show that commercials of H&M “A Magical Holiday” uses multimodality to attract the audience through six modes: linguistic, audio, spatial, oral, visual, and gestural modes. In this study, I analyzed the ways by multimodal discourse analysis by Kress and Leeuwen onto the six methods. To analyze the advertisement, using the study by Chan and Chia on modes in multimodality. This research is using qualitative analysis by Schreier (2012) since it deals with the connection between all the semiotic modes to bring the message of the advertisement. I analyzed the data by putting the scenes into six tables based on the ways. After that, I explained the interrelation between each mode. Based on the analysis, the ways helped the advertisers to convey the real message of the video. Beyond the moral message of the story, the advertisement is a marketing tool to promote their products.",
