  "title": "Meaning in the process of signification of Lancôme’s Beauty serum advertisements",
  "abstract": "This thesis mainly deals with the process of signification in order to reveal how meaning is created by the advertisement of Lancôme’s Génifique Serum (2009) and Lancôme’s Advanced Génifique Serum (2013) through the use of verbal expression supported by the visual expression. The focus of the writer’s analysis is the advertisements themselves as the writer will use the process of signification which involves denotation and connotation. Those theories will help the writer in analyzing the meaning of the advertisement first, and then figure out how meaning is created by the advertisement. This research uses qualitative content analysis method to describe the meaning of qualitative materials in a systematic way. From the analysis, the writer found out that meaning is created by connotation that is contained by expressions of the advertisements.",
