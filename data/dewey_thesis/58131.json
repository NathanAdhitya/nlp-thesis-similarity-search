  "title": "Consumerism and the image of women as constructed in AH’s family-themed YouTube video contents",
  "abstract": "This thesis presents three videos from AH YouTube Channel and investigates the consumerism and image of women as constructed in the videos. These issues are observed within Fairclough’s 3D framework of critical discourse analysis which also analyzes the discursive and social practices surrounding the video production. In the textual level, I elaborate the visual elements used in the thumbnail, involving the camera shot, gaze, color, image positioning, and title. In the discourse practice level, the analysis focuses on the intention of the text producer and his strategy to win the power relation. In the social dimension, I describe the way Atta uses his power to portray the social reality and change the viewer’s perspective. The research findings show that consumerism is presented through mixing several discourses to recontextualize sign-consumption practices and further influence the viewers’ perspective toward consumerism. Moreover, even though the text depicts Atta’s mother and wife as modern urban women, they are still constructed as objects in the videos. The text producer ascribes some attributes and roles to the women to support the narrative and promote the ideology of consumerism.",
