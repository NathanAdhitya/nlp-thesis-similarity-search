  "abstract": "Take A Girl Like You is one of Amis's work that tells about Jenny Bunn's development as the main character. Jenny, a traditional Northern girl who lives in a modem society in the South faces a problem in dealing with her new society. The important thing is the difference of Jenny's principle of life against the Southern society's. At first, she is reluctant to join the modem and free-and-easy way of life of her new environment especially in the liberal sexual life which is offered by Patrick, her boy friend. At the end, she follows his way of life. The writer wants to know why Jenny follows Patrick's, while she at first is so persistent in not having sex before marriage. Thus, in this thesis, the writer is interested in analyzing the development of Jenny Bunn in the process of changing her principle of life in her new environment. She uses the theory of characterization, conflict and setting in order to back up her analysis on Jenny's development. Jenny has changed her former principle of life because of the pressure of her new environment. She has no other way than follow its way of life. The influence of her new environment cannot be borne by her.",
