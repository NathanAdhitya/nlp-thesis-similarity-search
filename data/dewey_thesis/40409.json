  "abstract": "This study analyzes the phenomenon of the older women and younger men relationship that is applied in Korean dramas. With the ideology of patriarchy which is still rooted in Korean society, I am going to analyze the phenomenon of older women and younger men from three different dramas whose characterizations are different from the usual patriarchal system. This thesis aims at revealing how the characteristics that the characters possess are able to make them interested in their relevant partners. Therefore, I analyze the characters’ traits based on the theories of gender stereotypes by Thomas (2001) and Rosenkrantz (Brannon, 1996). Through this analysis, I find out that the younger men do possess different traits from their gender stereotypes but at the same time, they also still maintain the masculinity traitthey are supportive, obedient and protective. Meanwhile, the older women’s main attraction is that they still act as the nurturers, regardless of their less submissiveness in the relationship. Thus, these characteristics unite and they are still able to make each of them attracted to their partners. Through these findings, it can be concluded that the differences here can happen because the characters do not particularly believe in and follow the traditional patriarchal system anymore.",
