  "title": "The paradoxical world of Psycho-Pass anime series",
  "abstract": "Science-fiction anime is one of the most popular genres of anime. One of its sub-genres is dystopian anime. Psycho-Pass is one of the most well-known examples. It tells the story of 22nd century Japan that is ruled by a system known as the Sibyl System. The world of Psycho-Pass is portrayed to be an ideal world that is seemingly crime-free. However, it is evident that the world contains many problems that oppose its ideal condition. In this study, I aim to show how the world of Psycho-Pass can be said to be a paradoxical world. To do so, I will use utopia and dystopia theories to look for elements in Psycho-Pass. From my analysis, I found that both elements are present, with each utopian element having dystopian elements to oppose it. Although the world may seem perfect, the reality is that it is faulty. In the end, it can be proven that the world of Psycho-Pass is indeed a paradoxical one since it contains both utopian and dystopian elements.",
