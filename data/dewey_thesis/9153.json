  "title": "A Study of cultural displacement of Anju and Sudha as seen in chitra banerjee divakaruni's the vine of desire",
  "abstract": "The vine of desire by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni is Divakurni?s trilogy which reflects immigrants? life and their problems in the adopted land. Since her novel talks about immigrants? life it will affect in the cultural problems. The cultural problems in this novel are dominated by cultural displacement which happens on Anju and Sudha. Their displacement is caused by their dissatisfaction about Indian cultural values. Their displacement experience makes them throw away the Indian cultural values and adopts American culture, which makes them have the ambivalence later. To reveal the displacement in the Anju and Sudha I use culture displacement and ambivalence concepts, therefore, the two concepts are included into cultural studies. In the analysis, I find their desires to be free from Indian cultural values cooptation, through their dreams and rebellions. Besides, I find also their ambivalence attitudes through their adaptation with new land. The conclusion of my analysis is ambivalence identity of Anju and Sudha, which is affected by their displacement. They create middle culture by combine American and Indian cultures in their life and I call it as ambivalence identity.",
