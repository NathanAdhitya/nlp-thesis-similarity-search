  "abstract": "Mutual fund has been an investment alternative for an investor who has not enough capital but he wants to play in capital market. In Indonesia not many people understand about mutual fund Mutual fund is still a strange instrument. Because not many people understand about mutual fund, auditor wants to observe about the return and risk of mutual fund In many newspaper and magazines many of mutual fund claim that they can give investor high return and low risk. Auditor uses Sharpe, Treynor and Jensen measure as a tool for investor to know about the return and risk from a mutual fund Audhitor observe and want to know about three measures. How they can measure a mutual fund performance and how about their strength and weakness. Auditor uses Nicholas fund as a sample for this observation and auditor also use Treasury Bills as a risk free rate and Standard & Poor 500 as market risk. From the observation, auditor found that Sharpe measure is better than Treynor and Jensen measure because Sharpe measure uses total risk and Sharpe also explain more complex and deep about the return and risk from mutual fund. Treynor is better than Jensen measure because Treynor does not ignore the risk. Jensen measure ignores return and just use the risk as a predictor. Jensen says that a good mutual fund is a mutual fund, which has a low risk. A mutual fund which have high risk is bad.",
