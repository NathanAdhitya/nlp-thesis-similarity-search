  "abstract": "This thesis is about John Steinbeck's The Winter of Our Discontent. It discusses about the moral decline that is the shoddy attitudes toward honesty and success. It seems that dishonesty becomes common since everyone does it in order to reach success. Here, the main character of this novel, Ethan is described as an honest man at first, but later falls into the same pattern of dishonesty. In relevance to this, the writer of this thesis wants to reveal that there are several things which lead the main character to these changes. Among the important factors are the influence of his social milieu and his desire to live in economic security so that he can satisfy his family by providing them with a lot of money. Through the description of Ethan\"s social milieu, it can be seen that he follows the trend of his society merely as the result that although he has tried hard he still cannot have a comfortable life for his family. The desire to have material success for his family never ceases which finally leads him to change his ways. Ethan really shows a great change in his life. However, he is actually the victim of his corrupt society since all of his changes are influenced by the social milieu.",
