  "title": "The impact of airline service quality towards customers repurchase intention in airline industry in Indonesia with brand image as the mediator: a case of Lion Air",
  "abstract": "Lion Air is an Indonesian low-cost carrier brand, which owns the largest market share in the Indonesian domestic-flight. Regardless of its notoriety for poor service quality and numerous accidents, Lion Air has a constant growth in its yearly total passenger. Although it is known that in a service industry, service quality is crucial to motivate customers to repurchase the service, in the case of Lion Air, customers seem to react otherwise. Therefore, this study aims to find out the impact of airline service quality towards repurchase intention with the brand image as the mediator. The data was gathered by distributing questionnaires to 111 respondents from all around Indonesia who have ever flown with Lion Air in this past ten years using simple random sampling. The data is analysed using path analysis and Sobel Test. The findings approve that airline service quality influences repurchase intention. Furthermore, the findings conclude that brand image mediates the relationship between airline service quality and repurchase intention.",
