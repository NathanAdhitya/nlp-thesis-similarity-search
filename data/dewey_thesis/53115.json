  "abstract": "This study aims to find out the language styles used by Secondate, one of Indonesia's beauty brands, in the Instagram account captions. The writer did this study to find the language styles based on word choice in the Instagram account captions for the product Milky Gel Lip Tint in two different semesters between 30 November 2020 to 27 December 2021. In addition, the writer observed the similarities and differences in the language style based on word choice variation in the first and second semesters. In conducting this study, the writer used the theory of language styles based on word choice by Keraf (2006) which utilizes three indicators namely sentence length, structure, and vocabulary, the theory of inversion by Tarigan (1985), the theory of syntax by Chaer (2007), and the theory of standard Indonesian by Prihantini (2015). This study was done using a qualitative approach. The data analysis showed that Secondate used many informal and conversational language styles and rarely used the formal language style. In the first semester, the Secondate Instagram account included a more formal language style than in the second semester. The writer suggested further study to involve more Instagram accounts or other social media platforms.",
