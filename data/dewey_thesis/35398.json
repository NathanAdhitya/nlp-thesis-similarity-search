  "abstract": "In this study, the writer would discuss some types of teacher roles which can be implemented in the classroom. The purpose was to find out the types of teacher roles applied in the conversation class and the types of students responses. The subject of this study was a teacher who teaches a conversation class to senior high school students. The writer used the theories of types of teacher roles by Harmer (2001 and 2007) and Edge & Garton (2007). To find out the students responses, the writer used the theory of type of students responses by Brown (2007). The writer used classroom observation and recording to collect the data. In addition, the writer recorded in two meetings of the conversation class. The findings revealed that there were six types of teacher roles applied in this class: controller, organizer, assessor, resource, observer, and motivator played based on their functions. In addition, there were five types of students responses towards the teacher roles. They were specific, choral, open-ended, off task, and silence responses. From this study, it could be concluded that the teacher played the five types of teacher roles to engage the active participation from the students shown through the students responses.",
