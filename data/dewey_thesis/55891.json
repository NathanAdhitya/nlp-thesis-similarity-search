  "title": "Remediating masculinity in the adaptation of seperti dendam, rindu harus dibayar tuntas",
  "abstract": "This study examines the remediation of masculinity from the novel Seperti Dendam, Rindu, Harus Dibayar Tuntas (2014) to its film adaptation of the same title in 2021. The adaptation from novel to film shows how masculinity as the subject of both texts are remediated from the men in the novel to the women in the film. This research elaborates how this remediation takes place by examining the characterization, the theme and the context of both texts, and the effect of this remediation to the shifting discourses of masculinity in both texts. The theories used are masculinity (with the focus on hegemonic masculinity and hypermasculinity) and adaptation theories (with the focus on remediation). This research concludes that despite the transfer of masculinity from men in the novel to women in the film, women are still considered as the other, and the excessive display of masculinity in both texts only shows the invisibility of femininity; and this confirms the position of femininity in the bottom hierarchy of sexualities.",
