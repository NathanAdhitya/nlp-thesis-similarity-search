  "title": "The Analysis of handling complaint to keep customers' satisfaction in Bouvigne Paradijs Restaurant",
  "abstract": "This thesis is written by the writers in order to fulfill the requirement to finish writer?s study in Hotel Management of Petra Christian University, Indonesia and in CHN (Christelijke Hogeschool Noord- Nederland). The objective of this thesis is to maintain customers? satisfaction after they complain for the bad services that they have experienced in this restaurant. The writers have chosen this topic because until this moment, there are a lot of customers who complain for the bad services in the restaurant, such as they have to wait for a long time for the drinks they have ordered and sometimes customers who sit in the back area (Bouvignezaal and Kasteelzaal) often complain because no waiter in charge in that area. So far, there is no action to be taken by the restaurant to overcome that situation",
