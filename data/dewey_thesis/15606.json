  "title": "The Study of phatic function as seen on si Doel Anak Sekolahan III, episode: 'keterbukaan' and 'yang tersesat dalam mimpi'",
  "abstract": "Phatic function is a part of interactional function of language that is normally used to establish and maintain relationship with other people. The assumption that Indonesian people have a great sense of communal, makes the writer curious to know about phatic function, especially how 'phatic' is expressed in Indonesian cultural setting. As the source of data, the writer uses sinetron 'Si Doel Anak Sekolahan III, episodes 'Keterbukaan' and 'Yang Tersesat Dalam Mimpi' . She is interested to investigate the phatic utterances that are found in the conversations, in terms of sentence types , and also lexical items in which she groups them into their semantic and syntactic classes of words . The classification is intended to get the common ideas of lexical fields which are normally used by characters to convey phatic utterances. The phatic use in the episodes are identified based on Malinowski's concepts of phatic, that phatic communion is where the words do not convey meaning but have a purely social function. As a result of the study, she finds that there are 80 phatic utterances found in the analysis. Many of them are conveyed in the lexical field of familiarity and daily activities are mostly conveyed in the type of interrogative sentence.",
