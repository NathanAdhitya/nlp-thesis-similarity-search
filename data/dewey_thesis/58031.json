  "title": "Implementation of UI/UX design for a new digital report system",
  "abstract": "This research provides an overview of the implementation of UI/UX design of an interactive digital report system for Dealroom.co. The aim of the study was to address the limitations of the existing static report by testing a user-friendly and searchable platform that improves the usability and interactivity of the reports. The research utilized a combination of user testing, data analysis, and literature review to evaluate the usability, effectiveness, and user experience with the new system. The findings highlight the significance of incorporating intuitive navigation, interactive features, and clear data visualization, to optimize the user experience and improve the overall effectiveness of the interactive report. Five participants took part in the test. The design was well received and the results were positive, even though there is room for improvements.",
