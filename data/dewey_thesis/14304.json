  "abstract": "The thesis writer uses Soldiers' Pay as the material to study the indirect impact of World War I on human beings to prove that the war does give a great impact on them. The study is conducted by applying the theory of conflict and the theory of characterization to describe the indirect impact of the war on the characters in the novel; those are Cecily Saunders, Parson Mahon, Robert Saunders, and Minnie Saunders. The indirect impact that the writer analyzes focuses on their conflicts and the revelation of their character traits as the result of Donald's being \"silent\". Because of that reason, the writer includes the analysis of the character traits of the characters before Donald's being \"silent\" and their character traits as the result of Donald's \"silent\". The return of the soldier, who is very much changed by the war, causes the characters to react differently in their own ways. Those different reactions trigger the appearance of their external and internal conflicts, and the reactions also reveal their real character traits. She concludes that directly or indirectly, the First World War indeed gives a great impact on the characters as reflected in their conflicts and in the revelation of their real character traits.",
