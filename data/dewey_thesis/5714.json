  "title": "A Study of the narrative structure in Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code as seen through Sophie Neveu",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of Dan Brown?s novel The Da Vinci Code. Through this thesis, I pay attention and show the narrative structure of the novel which is seen through the main woman character, Sophie Neveu. As a tool to help me in analyzing the novel, I choose to use Literary Approach streaming in Structuralism. From that point, I choose Binary Opposition by A.J. Greimas which are exposing the Subject - Object, the Sender - Receiver, the Helper - Opponent that exist in Sophie Neveu. By means of deconstructing A.J. Greimas?s theory on Binary Opposition I analyzed Sophie Neveu as the only character to be posted in each point of the binary opposition. She becomes the Subject when she has the desire to break the codes. The Object part is revealed when she is suspected by the police for her involvement in the museum curator?s murder. Her role as the Sender is seen through the interaction that she has with Robert Langdon, when she has orders or commands for him. A part when she receives all the codes from her grandfather becomes the proof for her being the receiver. As the Helper she uses her knowledge to have a smoother way in revealing the truth about the quest and she becomes the Opponent when she does something with lack of consideration.",
