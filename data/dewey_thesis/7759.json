It is analyzed based on Garcia?s refusal strategies (1989) supported by Kartomihardjo?s refusal strategies (1993). It concerns the refusal strategy to an order by shop assistants in Plaza Tunjungan Surabaya. The data were taken from 40 respondents: 20 male shop assistants and 20 female shop assistants in Plaza Tunjungan Surabaya. The research found that the male shop-assistants preferred to use reason/explanation, mitigated refusal, expression of regret/sorrow, and direct refusal, while the female shop-assistants preferred to use reason/explanation, expression of regret/sorrow, direct refusal and mitigated refusal.
