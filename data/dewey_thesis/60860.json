  "title": "Creating brochures as a promotional tool for Swiss-Belhotel Cendrawasih Biak",
  "abstract": "The problem that Swiss-Belhotel Cendrawasih Biak has right now is its hotel brochure. The hotel brochure is unhighlighted in its USP, inconsistent in font, varied in colors, and poorly designed. This problem was mainly caused by the hotel not prioritizing a well-designed and informative brochure. The solution was to create a brochure and improve the content of the brochure to catch the eye of potential customers and highlight the USP. The data collection method used was a questionnaire. The questionnaire involved 18 guests of Swiss-Belhotel Cendrawasih Biak. The main changes the writer made in the brochure are highlighting the USP, using the hotelâ€™s red logo colour for brand identity, changing the font from Sanz to Cinzel, making the font more consistent, using more concise words in the language, and using more consistent language in the hotel brochure. By doing so, the writer helps the hotel increase the quality of its brochures and make them more consistent with their other promotional tools. As a result, the director of Swiss-Belhotel Cendrawasih Biak was very happy with the brochure, and the customers were more interested in reading the new hotel brochure.",
