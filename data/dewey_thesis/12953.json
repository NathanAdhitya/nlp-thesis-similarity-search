  "abstract": "This thesis is a study on the meaning of time in the relationship with human beings and God. It will analyze the cyclical pattern in human life that reveals the changes in time cycle and the meaning of human existence in this world. T. S. Eliot in this poem, East Coker would like to show the routinity in human life that they should face, therefore, sometimes humankind are trapped in routinity which seems monotonous and get bored easily. The analysis is based on the use of metaphor, imagery and allusion in the poem. Through the analysis, the writer finds that in spite of the routine, human life is not meaningless because God has a purpose to create humankind.",
