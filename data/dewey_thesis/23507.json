  "abstract": "H.J. Heinz, known as one of the biggest global food companies in the world has recently set up a centralized European supply chain center in Zeist, The Netherlands. The centralization of supply chain activity required all supply chain business activities to adopt the new centralized structure including their indirect procurement activity. Heinz Indirect procurement department is currently responsible for various business portfolios whic~1 include Supply chain, Facility management, Properties, ?Logistics, Energy, Sales and marketing, IT and Corporate services. Many product categories spend in the indirect procurement portfolios were consolidated and raised as a European level project to achieve more benefit for the company, Example of such product categories is Office supply product. Nevertheless, further recommendations are needed to allow the company for a larger benefit in the future. Increasing the project to global leverage for example and increasing the internal communication between central procurement and local area personnel are part of the recommended further options.",
