  "title": "Experimental study of an interior reinforced concrete beam-column joint subjected to cyclic loading",
  "abstract": "Beam-column joints are vital elements of reinforced concrete (RC) structures that need to be designed sufficiently to resist the lateral forces coming from earthquakes. Past studies have tried to develop more suitable types of beam-column joints in RC monolithic structures through various experimental investigations of beam-column joints to further assess their applicability and performance. In this experimental investigation, a pseudo-static experimental test of a one-way interior monolithic beam-column joint was carried out. The specimen was designed according to ACI 318-14 and is expected to fail in the beam flexural mechanism. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the specimen meets the expected failure mechanism and performance acceptance criteria from ACI 374.1-05 and ASCE 41-06. The specimen met the expected failure mechanism as it failed in the beam flexural mechanism. The specimen satisfied the requirement for strength degradation and energy dissipation ratio but did not satisfy the requirement for residual stiffness. The specimen met the evaluation requirements for collapse prevention performance level.",
