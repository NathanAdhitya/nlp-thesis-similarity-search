  "abstract": "Welded connections are commonly used connection in steel buildings. However, the properties of a welded connection vary depending on the quality of the weld. This raises a problem because not all welders can weld perfectly and there are usually more than one welder working on the connections in one building. The primary objective of this study is to find out how variation in weld quality affects the performance of a building. Six OpenSEES models of ten-story buildings were examined. The buildings were modeled using spring model in the connection and the parameters of the spring such as initial stiffness, strength, and strain-hardening ratio were modified according to the weld quality. The distribution of the weld quality was also different for each model. Non-linear time history analysis was conducted in the models.",
