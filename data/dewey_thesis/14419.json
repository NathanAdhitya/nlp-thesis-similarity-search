  "abstract": "This study is about first language acquired by a two-and-a-half-year-old Indonesian child. The focus is on word order of the utterances produced by the child. The thesis writer analyzes the child's utterances, particularly the two-word utterances and the three/more-word utterances. By combining words, the child forms phrases and clauses/sentences. The writer tries to find some evidences of growing complexity of the child's language over the four-month period of observation. This is a case study of a child whose utterances were recorded over a period of four months. The data used in this research contain two to more than two words in sequence. These were categorized based on word classes used. The result of this study reveals that during the four-month period of observation the child develops her language by constructing phrases and clauses/sentences. As the time of study goes by, the child expands her language not only her vocabulary but also in the length of constructions. The thesis writer then concludes that there is a growing complexity in the child's language development.",
