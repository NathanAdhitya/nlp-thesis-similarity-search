  "title": "The Life development of Alex-Li Tandem in Zadie Smith's The Autograph Man",
  "abstract": "The Autograph Man is a novel by Zadie Smith. The Novel is about the story revolving a young man by the name of Alex-Li Tandem who goes through a stage of life development in his life. In the thesis, I am interested to see what are the reasons for Alex-Li Tandem to have those crises and how he copes with them. In order to do that, I use the psychological approach and use the theory of life development by Erik H. Erikson. Eriksonâ€™s theory is about the life development stages, which is divided into eight stages, ranging from birth until old age. The theory is about the balance within each stage towards the positive and negative disposition. The Positive disposition is called maladaptation, while the negative disposition is called malignancies. In my research, I find that Alex-Li Tandem has the inclination to the malignancies in each stage of his life. In order to overcome those maladaptations or malignancies, each person may have varied processes of finding the solution for each stage. Different individual may have different method in overcoming the maladaptations or malignancies that he faces within each stage of his or her life.",
