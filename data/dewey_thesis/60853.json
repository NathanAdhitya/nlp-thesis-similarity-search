  "title": "Two feminist waves and two cultures in Little Women: an adaptation studies",
  "abstract": "This thesis looks at how Louisa May Alcott's Little Women was adapted into a 2022 Korean series, focusing on feminist themes in two different cultures. It shows how both the original book and its Korean version deal with issues about choices (job and marital affairs), behavior (manner, language, and emotional expressions) and women's roles (provider and family leader). By applying principles of the second and third waves of feminism, the study highlights the shift from challenging Victorian ideals to interrogating Korean modern feminist views in South Korea. The research points out the ongoing importance of feminist ideas and how they can cross cultural boundaries through adaptations. The results add to adaptation studies by showing how stories can be reimagined to reflect various feminist values and the changing empowerment of women in different times and places.",
