  "title": "An annotated translation book entitled Hidden Potential",
  "abstract": "In translating, difficulties often emerge during the translation process. In this annotated translation project, the book translated from English to Bahasa Indonesia is entitled Hidden Potential written by Wendy Pope. Annotated translation is a form of introspective and retrospective research where the translator translates a text while at the same time, writing a commentary regarding the translation process. This research aims to share information concerning the difficulties faced by the researcher and to describe the strategies in translating the Christian book. By using Mona Bakerâ€™s translation strategies such as translation by a more general word, translation by a more neutral word, translation by cultural translation, translation by omission, translation by illustration, the problems in the translation process can be solved This annotated translation project uses all of the above, except translation by illustration since this book contains only words without any pictures or illustration.",
