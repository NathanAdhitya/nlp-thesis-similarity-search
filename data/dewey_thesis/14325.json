  "title": "The Rootlessness of Jake Donaghue in Iris Murdoch's under the net",
  "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the rootless life of the hero-narrator, Jake Donaghue in Iris Murdoch's Under the Net. The writer is challenged to analyze the novel to find out how Jake reflects the idea of the rootlessness. By using characterization to examine the main character, the writer finds out that Jake's charac-ter has flaws. He is lazy, selfish, and foolish. He is selfish because he does not care for other people. His friends refuse to let him stay in their houses. Jake then becomes homeless and he roams around the city. Thus, physically he is rootless. Also because of his selfishness, Jake's life becomes meaningless. He has no purpose in life and therefore he also experiences emotional rootlessness.",
