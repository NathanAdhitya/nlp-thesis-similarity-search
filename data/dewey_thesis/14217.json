  "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with a study of conflicts that Mr. Sammler, an old Jewish man, always confronts in America. The thesis writer tries to capture Mr. Sammler's inner and outer conflicts until one day he feels alienated. She is curious to know how the conflicts can lead Mr. Sammler to his alienation. Her purpose of this study is to analyze the conflicts between Mr. Sammler and the three young people, such as Angela Gruner, Wallace Gruner and a black pickpocket. Besides, she wants to show that the conflicts are caused by two factors. The generation gap problem between Mr. Sammler and the three young people is one factor. Obviously, the old and the young generations hold completely dif-ferent values. Furthermore, the city where Mr. Sammler lives also becomes another factor that brings about the conflicts. Literary approach, such as conflict, characterization and setting are used to analyze the work by the thesis writer. Finally, the painful conflicts drive Mr. Sammler to be a sad and lonely Jewish man in a crowded American society.",
