  "title": "The analysis of two video games for English language learning: Bobby Bola & Peri Buku Ajaib 3 and Anak Pintar seri English? no problem!",
  "abstract": "This study is aimed to find out the extent to which two English learning video games, namely Bobby Bola & Peri Buku Ajaib 3 and Anak Pintar seri English? No Problem! meet the 10 principles for designing video games for foreign learning proposed by Purushotma, Thorne, and Wheatley (2009) and the similarities and differences between the two video games in relation to the 10 key principles. This study is a qualitative research in which the writer played each game for approximately 8 hours and used content analysis to analyze the video games. The findings of this study show that both games adhered only to some design principles. Bobby Bola & Peri Buku Ajaib 3, for example, seems to support the principle of “minimizing activities that players does not enjoy” while Anak Pintar seri English? No Problem! to some extent matched the principles of “content organized around tasks” and “metalinguistic descriptions and terminology presented as a supporting material”. This study would hopefully provide further information for those who wish to evaluate or use video games for foreign language learning.",
