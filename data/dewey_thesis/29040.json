  "title": "Illocutionary acts of the utterances of the main character and his son in the movie, life is beautiful: with and without hidden intention",
  "abstract": "Basically, this thesis is the research about illocutionary act types which are used by the main character, Guido and his son, Joshua when they are living in Nazi’s concentration camp in the movie, Life is Beautiful. Also, the writer chooses the theory of illocutionary act from Searle as her main theory in analyzing the data. In this thesis, the writer identifies the types of illocutionary act that occurs in the speaker’s utterances, especially the main character, Guido’s utterances and the frequency of each type. The writer finds out three types of illocutionary act that Guido uses which are assertive, directive, and expressive. Besides, in some of his assertive, Guido sometimes uses utterance which consists of hidden intention. In contrast, the writer finds five types of illocutionary act in Joshua’s utterances, and none of his utterances consist hidden intention. As the conclusion, the writer finds various types and the frequency of illocutionary act which are used by both Guido and Joshua. She also finds out about which Guido’s utterances that have his hidden intentions. So, in the utterances that the people utter, usually consist of illocutionary act types, and we can understand the intention of the speaker through illocutionary act types.",
