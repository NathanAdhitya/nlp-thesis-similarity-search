  "title": "The Refusal strategies to a date invitation used by female Chinese students and female Javanese students in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "This study aims to identify the differences and the similarities of the refusal strategies used by thirty Javanese and thirty Chinese female university students in refusing a date invitation by comparing the occurrence of each strategy. The data were gathered from three universities in Surabaya, Airlangga, Surabaya, and Petra. There were three main theories that are used in this study: The Refusal Strategies by Carmen Garcia (1992), Head Acts and Supportive Moves by Blum-Kulka (1989), and Politeness Strategies by Scollon and Scollon (1983). The writer found that the female Chinese students preferred using Direct Refusal and Mitigated Refusal as the Head Acts, while female Javanese students preferred using Direct Refusal, Expression of Regret or Sorrow, and Mitigated Refusal as the Head Acts. The writer also found that most of the respondents preferred using Giving Reason or Explanation, and Expression of Regret or Sorrow as the Supportive Moves. These facts may imply that the Javanese students tend to avoid saying ?no? by using Deference Politeness, while the Chinese students tend to be straightforward by using Solidarity Politeness in refusing a date invitation. The last but not the least, the writer found that the female students frequently used Expression of Regret or Sorrow, Direct Refusal/ Mitigated Refusal, Giving Reason as the pattern in refusing a date invitation.",
