  "title": "Analysis of the performance of polypropylene fibre modified concrete",
  "abstract": "This study explores polypropylene fiber-modified concrete performance by measuring shrinkage cracks, compressive strength, flexural strength, water absorption, capillarity, permeability, and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The inclusion of polypropylene fibers into the concrete mix increases the compressive strength of concrete significantly by about 5,9 % up to 10,3 % at 7 and 28 days, respectively. The presence of polypropylene fibers in the concrete mix improves the flexural strength of concrete significantly by about 6,8 % up to 16,2 % at 7 and 28 days. Polypropylene fibers have an appreciable effect in reducing the water absorption of concrete; the addition of polypropylene fibers into concrete has shown a substantial reduction in the capillarity of concrete. The magnitude of permeability of the polypropylene fiber-modified concrete seems to decrease compared to the one without fibers. The reading of ultrasonic pulse velocity of polypropylene fiber modified concrete consistent with the compressive strength. As the transmit time required reduces, the compressive strength rises. The addition of 0,9 kg/m3 of polypropylene fibers into concrete does not induce any crack formation.",
