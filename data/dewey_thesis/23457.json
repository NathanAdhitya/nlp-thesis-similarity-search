Through the discussion, it can be seen that Laurel's past memories actively influence and assist her to overcome her external and internal conflicts. Memories come whenever Laurel needs them. It is possible because she has memory which can store her past experiences and recall them back. By recalling and musing over those past memories, Laurel is able to overcome all her conflicts successfully. At last, based on the discussion, it is proved that memory is really important for everyone. Because of the memory, one can learn something from the experience in the past which can be useful in the present.",
