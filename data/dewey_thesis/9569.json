  "abstract": "This study aims to determine the stylistic devices in disagreement used by Nick Carraway toward the three interlocutors, Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom based on different status as found in the novel entitled The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald. In analyzing it, the writer applied Garcia?s theory (1989) on Stylistic Devices in Disagreement. From the analysis, it can be seen the occurrences of both confrontational and non confrontational devices in expressing disagreement. In the conversation encounters between Carraway and Gatsby, the device ?Criticism of a third party? is mostly used by Carraway in his disagreements. It means that Carraway is more confrontational toward Gatsby. In the conversations encounter between Carraway and Daisy, `Giving reason? is frequently used by Carraway. This device is also frequently used by Carraway toward Tom. In other words, Carraway tends to be more non confrontational toward Daisy and Tom. The explanations above show how Carraway differs in expressing his disagreement toward each of his interlocutors. Status influences the use of stylistic devices or linguistic choices.",
