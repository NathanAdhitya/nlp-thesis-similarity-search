  "title": "Meaning in American Dove shampoo commercial campaign",
  "abstract": "Social media has given big influence on society because people always get attached to social media for finding their leisure and keeping up to date. Because of that reason, some advertisement does not advertised on the television but in the social media. Dove shampoo also sees this condition and uses social media to spread its campaign to change people’s perception about the meaning of beauty. In this research, I want to know the meaning of Dove shampoo commercial campaign in social media. There are two theories that I use in this research; they are semiotic by Saussure, Rolland Barthes, and Charles Peirce. The approach that I use in this study is qualitative approach. I found out that Dove shampoo commercial campaign mostly has a purpose to change American people’s perception about having curly hair because they think curly hair is bad. Moreover, curly hair is associated with color people which are low class people. Indonesian viewers cannot get message because they do not have that kind of culture. They think that this commercial campaign talks about how to be proud about what you have. Finally, I recommend a further research on Dove shampoo commercial campaign.",
