  "title": "The meanings of fair skin in eight Unileverâ€™s skin-whitening advertisements in Indonesia",
  "abstract": "Fair skin in Indonesia has gained its popularity until now. It has happened because of the power of the media that has proven to persuade women to have fair skin as the idealized self for them. This study will investigate how fair skin is represented and how this representation in the eight advertisements on whitening products reflects consumerism. There are eight advertisements from Unilever that are analyzed in this study. This study focuses on the eight skin-whitening advertisements on YouTube between 2017-2019 and all of them have the same target market which is women in their 20s. In my analysis, I use representation and consumerism theory for finding the meanings that are produced and the symbolic meanings of consumerism behind those advertisements. Based on my analysis, there are two signs that are produced: youthfulness and success. First, youthfulness has the symbolic meanings of aesthetic, playful, and efficiency values. Second, success contains status and esteem values. To sum up, those eight skin-whitening advertisements are not only sold as products, but also as meanings that lead women to get their identity of beauty, success, and happiness.",
