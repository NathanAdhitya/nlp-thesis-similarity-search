  "title": "Competitive environment of Perfetti van Melle",
  "abstract": "The Dutch company, Perfetti van Melle have been a household name in the confectionery industry for many years since its establishment in 1840. Its product includes Alpenliebe, Chupa Chups and Mentos. With evergrowing competitions in the form of direct competitors such as Mars and Nestle, indirect competitors (competitors in the confectionery industry that only sell one type of products) such as Cadbury, Lindt and Fererro Rocher and external factors such as new laws being imposed by governments in Europe forcing to reduce suqar quantity in production process and also introduce sugar-free products, PvM as a company need to adapt and adjust their value chain in accordance to a fast-changing environment. This paper explores the value chain of PvM using the lens of Porterâ€™s 5 Force, focusing only on 4 out of the 5 forces: Threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of substitutes and bargaining power of buyer. This paper gives a conclusion that the threat of entry to compete with PvM and other larger confectionery and chewing gum firms is not powerful compared to the strong barriers of entry, the suppliers of PvM do not have much bargaining power, the threats of substitutes are little to none and buyers have a high bargaining power.",
