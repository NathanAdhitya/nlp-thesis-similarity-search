  "title": "A Study on Philip Carey's inner conflict which is caused by his love bondage and the way he overcome his inner conflict to be a mature person as seen in somerset Maugham's of human bondage",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of the main character in Maugham's Of Human Bondage, Philip Carey. The thesis writer is curious to know how Philip's love bondage toward Mildred Rogers causes his inner conflicts and how he overcomes his inner conflicts so that he becomes a mature person. Thus, in doing the analysis the thesis writer uses the theory of characterization and conflict, and psychological theory on maturity. Philip irrationally falls in love with Mildred. He cannot control his passionate love that binds him. Meanwhile, Mildred does not love him at all. She is coarse and indifferent to him. She shows her affection only when Philip gives her presents. She uses him for her own needs. Philip's passionate love causes his inner conflicts which brings him to his downfall. After Mildred abandons him for the second time, he realises that Mildred will never love him. Then, he decides to forget Mildred and search for his own happiness. He gives much attention to his study which has failed. Later on, he married Sally Athelny and they live happily ever after. Here Philip changes into a mature one since he becomes aware of his future, can accept his deformity, takes a lesson from his failure, and builds a happy family.",
