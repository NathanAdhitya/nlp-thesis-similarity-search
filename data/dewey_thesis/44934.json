  "title": "Designing a handbook to describe employee benefits for PT WY's new employees",
  "abstract": "PT WY is a manufacturing company located in Surabaya which produces household and personal care products. Their primary target market is the average Indonesian family. The main problem in this company is that new employees have no idea about what to expect from this company since there is no written form of information needed by the employees. By interviews and surveys that I conducted, the most crucial problem is about the employee benefits. Most of the employees did not know about the employee benefits of PT WY. The HRD representatives also agreed that the new employees often asked about the employee benefits. PT WY has the draft. However, it is not complete yet, so they did not distribute it. Therefore, the solution is creating a handbook to describe employee benefits for PT. WYâ€™s new employees based on the existing draft, theories from Bloomfield, Schofield, and Cantesbury (2015) and Martocchio (2016), and information from the company. This handbook is expected to help both the company and the employees to refer to the handbook when it comes to the employee benefits.",
