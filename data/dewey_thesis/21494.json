  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of ths idea? of war by two poets, Wilfred Owen and Carl Sandburg. Both of them, Owen as a soldier and Sandburg as a journalist, wrote the poems during the First World War, The writer of this thesis finds out that although they come from different background, one is directly involved in war and the other is not, both of them have similar ideas. War is leading men to cruelly and inhumane actions because in war, the soldiers kill their enemies brutally and uncompromisingly. They have ta do it to defend their lives, or otherwise they will he killed. However, war does not give aGscjuats return to tne soldiers' sacrifice. Besides cruelty and dsrhmnanization, war is also bringing men to misery, that is groat suffering of mind or body and great misfortunes because war wastes their lives, time, hope and money. Through Owen?s and Sandburg's poems, the writer of this thesis will prove that the propaganda about war, i.e, those who died in war woul d be considered as heroes, is a lie",
