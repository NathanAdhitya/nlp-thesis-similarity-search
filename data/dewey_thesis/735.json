  "title": "The Transformation of lady Windermere in Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan",
  "abstract": "As the female character of Lady Windermere's Fan, Lady Windermere is described as a woman who owns a rigid view of morality who then because of certain conditions changes her view. Starting from this fact, I am interested to analyze the transformation of Lady Windermere. I want to find out the kind of woman Lady Windermere before she changes, the process of her change, and also her transformation. To acquire this purpose, characterization, conflict and ways of overcoming a conflict are needed to analyze the topic. In the analyses, I find out that before the change, Lady Windermere is a rigid woman when it concerns morality; she sees what is good and what is bad as a dichotomy. Yet, based on her later experience, which shows that people may do both good and bad deeds, she eventually finds that she is actually cannot divide what is good and what is bad in the way she used to do. Realizing it, she decides to change her previous view. From the analysis, I can conclude that a change happens because a person has experienced a significant event that has affected him or her greatly.",
