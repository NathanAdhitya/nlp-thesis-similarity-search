  "title": "The Rites of passage of Nina Sayers in Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan",
  "abstract": "This study aims to discuss Nina Sayers’ rites of passage which are portrayed through the use of many kinds of symbols. Each stage of rites of passage is represented by symbols. The purpose of this analysis is to discuss the way Nina Sayers’ rites of passage are symbolized. Therefore, I will use the theory of rites of passage and the concept of symbols. The theory of rites of passage is applied to match the symbols with characteristics of each stage. The concept of symbols is applied to analyze the symbols of Nina Sayers’ rites of passage so that the meanings are appropriate to the contexts and able to show the way Nina Sayers’ rites of passage are symbolized. The analysis shows that each stage of Nina Sayers’ rites of passage is symbolized by many forms of symbols, such as names, colors, objects, place, emotion, gestures, and events. Moreover, it also shows that symbols of rites of passage can actually hold more than one meaning as they can change meanings in each stage of rites of passage. In the end, it can be concluded that symbols in Black Swan have been effectively used to strongly reveal the rites of passage.",
