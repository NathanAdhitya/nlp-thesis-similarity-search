  "abstract": "The study of this research is about the comparison of codes used by Petra Christian University?s lecturers and students in their Facebook postings. In this research, I want to find out the codes and their frequencies used by both lecturers and students in their Facebook postings. Besides, I also want to find out the differences and/or similarities of the codes used by both groups of respondents. In doing this research, I use the descriptive ? qualitative approach. The data of this research is the words in various codes used in both lecturers and students? Facebook postings. The subjects of this research are 10 (ten) lecturers and 30 (thirty) students of Petra Christian University. In collecting the data, I take 5 (five) latest Facebook postings from each respondent. After taking the postings, I identified, classified, and then analyzed the postings. From this research, I found out that both groups preferred using formal varieties, such as Standard Indonesian and English; instead of the non-formal ones, such as Non-Standard Indonesian. In this case, people from different age and status might not be really different in choosing the code used, especially in Facebook postings.",
