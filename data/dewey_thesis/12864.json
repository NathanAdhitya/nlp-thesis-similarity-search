  "title": "A Portrait of mother-daughter relationship: a struggle for communication in Amy Tan's the kitchen God's wife",
  "abstract": "Not many people do realize that sometimes, mother-daughter relationship is much more complicated than they can imagine, and that not every mother can communicate well with their daughter, though they speak the same language. Thus, the study of Amy Tan's The Kitchen God's Wife is aimed to analyze the problem of communication between a China-bom mother and her American-bom daughter. Basically their problem of communication is caused by their cultural differences which have great influences upon their ways of thinking. It is described that the impact of the problem of communication between the mother and the daughter cause them to have prejudice upon each other and inner disturbance of hiding secret from each other. While this problem of communication is going on and creating gap of relationship between them, there comes an initiative from the mother to start communicating with the daughter, that is by relating the story of her tragic life in the past to the daughter. Indeed, by relating herself to the daughter, the mother is finally able to change her daughter's perception upon her, encourage her to communicate with her mother, and even make her realize her essence as a Chinese' descent.",
