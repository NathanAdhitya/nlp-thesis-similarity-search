  "title": "Finite verb errors produced by the second year students of Petra I High School in their writing",
  "abstract": "This study is a qualitative study of the production of finite verb errors made by the high school students in their compositions. The data were collected from 30 writings which were written by the second year students of Petra 1 High School. The errors were analyzed in term of grammatical errors of the finite verbs (Strang, 1964), and in term of error analysis types (Littlewood, 1984). The results showed that in terms of grammatical errors, the majority of the students made errors in tenses, and in terms of error analysis types, many of the errors belong to the ambiguity type. In conclusion, the findings show that the students? ambiguity in understanding tense is responsible for their errors in producing finite verb tenses.",
