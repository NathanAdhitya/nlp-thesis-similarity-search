  "title": "Interactional styles used by Joy Mangano in 2015 Joy Movie",
  "abstract": "Interactional styles show the dominant attitudes displayed in the interaction (Holmes, 2006). Any gender can utilize feminine and masculine interactional styles while interacting or communicating, depending on certain situations (Holmes, 2006). The study aims to find out the interactional styles used by Joy Mangano in successful and unsuccessful negotiation scenes. The movie is about a woman who struggles to survive her life, forced to fall into the business world and become a successful business woman. The movie is taken from the 2015 Joy movie with Joy Mangano as the main character. The approach of the study is qualitative study. The study used one main theory about interactional styles by Holmes (2006) and one supporting theory about negotiation by Lewicki et al. (2003). The study found that Joy used two feminine and seven masculine interactional styles in the successful negotiation scenes. The study also found that Joy only used two feminine and five masculine interactional styles in the unsuccessful negotiation scenes.",
