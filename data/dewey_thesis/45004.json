  "title": "A multimodal discourse analysis of the notion of beauty in \"Dove Real Beauty Sketches\"",
  "abstract": "This thesis deals with multimodal discourse in analyzing the notion of beauty in a video by Dove. It aims at finding how Dove used multiple modes to create meaning conveyed in the beauty campaign video. The data is from the transcript. I start the analysis by drawing out the purpose of the expressions made by the participants using the theory of MDA to find the relation between the modes. In this analysis, I used a qualitative approach to explore the process of interaction of modes. The message of the campaign is that one person’s notion of beauty can be different from others’ perception of elegance about them. That person can think negatively, but other people may think positively. One’s notion of beauty can be changed by another person’s idea of beauty, from negative to positive. This message is supported by the relation of multiple modes found in the video.",
