  "title": "A Study on the good deed inside the evil sides of Richard Dudgeon in George Bernard Shaw's the devil's disciple",
  "abstract": "George Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple is about a young man named Richard Dudgeon, or Dick, whose tongue is satirical and bitter. His unfeeling treatment of his parents shows he has got no love for them. However, as the devil's disciple, Richard apparently can also do a good deed, that he decides to allow himself to be arrested and hanged on gallows in the place of a minister. Through characterization and conflict, the writer of the thesis applies the literary approach to analyse the good deed of the devil's disciple in order to discuss the motives Richard might have in acting like a Christ's disciple. After analysing Richard Dudgeon, finally there are no motives found in his good deed. His willingness to put his head in a noose is not for the sake of the minister or his wife. Good deeds are not performed for motives. No man who does what he does not want to do is a good man. Richard wants to sacrifice himself, and he will do the same for other people as he says. If Richard did what actually he did not want to do, he would not do the same for other people. His goodness has conquered his evil sides.",
