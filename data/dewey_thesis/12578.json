  "abstract": "This thesis concerns with the study of self- realization of the main characetr in Arthur Miller's e Price. The discussion is also to understand what the main character's conflicts are and how he comes to his self-realization. Victor has failed in his career and his marriage. These failures affect his sense of being. He feels desperate and empty. It is until he meets Solomon, a man who helps Victor look back to his past and supports him to face his life. Only after he learns and tries to examine what he has done in the past, he is able to understand himself. After reaching his self-realization, Victor becomes courageous to face his life. He can accept himself and others both as human beings and as unique persons. In short, Victor, the main character is succesful in reaching self- realization.",
