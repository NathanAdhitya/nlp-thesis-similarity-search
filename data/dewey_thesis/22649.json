  "title": "The Turn-taking strategies used by extroverted and introverted students of Petra Christian University Surabaya",
  "abstract": "According to Littauer (1996), there are two basic types of personality: extroverted and introverted, which may affect the way people think and behave. Based on this notion, I am curios to know if different types of personality may affect the different types of turn-taking strategies, which Stenstrom (1994) divide into three: taking the turn, holding the turn, and yielding the turn. From a study of 30 female students of Petra Christian University as my respondents (15 extroverted and 15 introverted), I found that both extroverted and introverted students used taking the turn the most, but the extroverted students used more holding the turn than the introverted students. The introverted students, on the other hand, used more yielding the turn than the extroverted students. The findings may be because the extroverts enjoy talking more, while the introverts enjoy being listeners.",
