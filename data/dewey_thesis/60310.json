  "title": "Scorch: a screenplay exploring the effects of capitalism to the working class and environment in a dystopian world",
  "abstract": "The planet is currently facing a crisis, and it is caused by none other than human activities, namely capitalism. Capitalism, in fact, does not only affect the workers or laborers but also the provider, nature. This creative thesis aims to show the effects of capitalism to the working people and environment in a dystopian world, where nature is on the brink of destruction, using screenplay as the media and dystopian genre. This creative work uses the theories of ecological Marxism, a combination of Ecocriticism, first coined by William H. Rueckert and Marxism by Karl Marx, and the theory of class struggle. Annie, an epitome of the working people, has to endure the alienation of her labor product, the exhaustion as capitalism leads to the long working hours and the product alienation, malnutrition due to the lack of food and water, as well as anxiety as her sister falls sick. The intense capitalistic production leads to resource depletion in the form of drought as well as the scorching heat Annie and the working people have to face every day. When they think the struggles cannot get any worse, the working people are being treated unjustly, causing mass action.",
