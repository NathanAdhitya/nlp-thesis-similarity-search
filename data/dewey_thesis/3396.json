  "abstract": "This thesis is about the main characters? pride and prejudice: The causes of Darcy?s pride and Elizabeth?s prejudice and the ways the main characters overcome the pride and prejudice to achieve their love as seen through Jane Austen?s Pride and Prejudice. Darcy?s pride and Elizabeth?s prejudice become the obstacles for both of them to achieve love, thus, they must do something to overcome their pride and prejudice. In order to accomplish the objective of this thesis, I analyze the causes of Darcy?s pride and Elizabeth?s prejudice and the efforts that they do to overcome the obstacles and finally achieve love. The analysis is to reveal the factors that cause Darcy to have pride and Elizabeth to have prejudice and also to find out the efforts that Darcy does to overcome his pride and the efforts that Elizabeth does to overcome her prejudice. I use literary approach through the literary device called characterization and conflict to support my analysis. I find out that, at the end, pride can make a person have bad prejudice toward others, and bad prejudice can `blind? people to see the truth. But Darcy and Elizabeth realize their mistakes and overcome their pride and prejudice and finally achieve their love. Finally I conclude that both Darcy and Elizabeth are successful in overcoming the obstacles by changing his manner and getting rid of her prejudice. Because of their love, they can conquer all obstacles.",
