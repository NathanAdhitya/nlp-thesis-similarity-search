  "abstract": "Testimonial is one of interesting features in Friendster and there are some of them which are difficult to understand. This study is conducted to investigate the respondents? difficulties in understanding some testimonials in Friendster and also to verify whether the readers? interpretation of those testimonials is the same with the testimonial?s writer or not. In collecting the data, the writer uses a set of questionnaire which is spread out to ten respondents to know their difficulties in understanding some Friendster?s testimonials. To reach the research objectives, some theories namely text and its context and also reference suggested by Halliday and Hasan (1989) in Discourse Analysis are used to help the writer in analyzing the data. The finding of this study shows that the respondents? difficulties in understanding some testimonials in Friendster lie in understanding the context and knowing the reference in the testimonial. The writer also finds out that even though there are some respondents who understand the testimonials in the questionnaire, most of their interpretations do not match as what the testimonial?s writer means. It shows that the reader?s understanding on context and knowing the reference in the testimonial determine the successfulness of the reader in understanding the testimonial.",
