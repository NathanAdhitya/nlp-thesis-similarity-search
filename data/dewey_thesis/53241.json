  "title": "Jaegu Song's borderline personality disorder in the webtoon Girls of the Wild's",
  "abstract": "Webtoon is a digital comic that spreads widely all over the world. One of the most famous ones called Girls of the Wild’s is a story about a young man who gets into a co-ed school. The young man, Jaegu Song, was first shown as a shy, quiet, and polite boy. However, throughout the series, Jaegu showed some weird and problematic behavior. This thesis will use borderline personality disorder theory to analyze Jaegu Song’s behavior. I will use the theory concerning the symptoms, causes, and effects to determine whether Jaegu Song suffers from a certain mental illness. After that this thesis will focus on his actions and dialogues, and his past and present events to give evidence on the analysis. This thesis results in analyzing what mental illness Jaegu Song suffered from. As a result, it shows that in the webtoon Girls of the Wild’s, Jaegu Song was actually shown to suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder. It can be found that someone might have developed a certain mental illness, even when they appeared to be fine or showed a rather normal action/response, and sometimes there must be some reasoning on why someone might be seen as problematic or seen as a bad person.",
