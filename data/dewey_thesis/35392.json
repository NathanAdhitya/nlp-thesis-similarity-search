  "title": "Written telephoning guidelines for the operators of Lotus Garden Hotel Kediri",
  "abstract": "I decided to make my BCFP project at Lotus Garden because it has a problem in telephoning behaviour. The operators in Lotus Garden cannot have proper greetings and conversation. From these problems, I think that the best solution for Lotus Garden Hotel is having written guidelines. These written guidelines are made in English and in Indonesian. It has two purposes why it is in English and in Indonesian. The first purpose is that it can lead the operators to know how to telephone well step by step so that they really understand about what they will do when they are telephoning with the customers. The second purpose is to help to get a plus impression for Lotus Garden Hotel. Thus, I made these written guidelines of telephoning in English and in Indonesian for hotel operators. The guidelines consist of receiving calls, making calls, leaving messages, taking messages, and dealing with the problems. The guidelines also include the forms that the operators can use in leaving messages, taking messages, and dealing with the problems to the customers in telephoning. The written guidelines will help the front office department where operators usually belong to. Because these written guidelines have all the important things which are the operators need, they can learn these written guidelines well.",
