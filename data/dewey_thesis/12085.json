  "abstract": "Stenden University accepts major international students, also Chinese students. Throughout practice period, most of the Chinese students acknowledge that they found difficulties. This research is to investigate whether there are some influences by the culture, which the Chinese students brought towards difficulties during the practice time. In order to develop research in student?s experiences, researchers use qualitative approach by interview towards the students. This study focused on Chinese students, which were doing their practice in Stenden University and Wyswert Hotel, especially the International Hospitality Management (IHM). As result, the research founds that there is culture influence during the Chinese students practice time. Culture barrier founded not only on basic skills of the Chinese students, but also on their relationship, communication style, and language. And this might caused that they are not familiar with the Dutch culture, and thus caused difficulties for them during practice and assessment. The work of this research is using theoretical part about cross-culture, Chinese culture, and Dutch culture.",
