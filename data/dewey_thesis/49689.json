  "title": "From crisis to strength: exploring children’s development of a balanced identity",
  "abstract": "My creative work is about identity development in children. I explore the stages of development and focus on the crisis at each stage. I also explore ways to pass the crises well so that the children can develop a balanced identity. As the basis of my writings, I have used two of Erik Erikson’s Eight Stages of Psychosocial Development. In the first and second stories, my main characters have to pass through the crisis of autonomy versus shame and doubt. They have strict and overprotective parents that caused them to doubt themselves. However, by believing in themselves and taking action, they passed the crisis and developed a balanced identity. In the third, fourth, and fifth stories, my main characters have to pass the crisis of initiative versus guilt. They have to be honest, forgive, and let go. Each action has its own risk, but by taking the initiative to do the right thing, they passed the crisis successfully and formed a balanced identity.",
