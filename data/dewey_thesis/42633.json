  "title": "Promoting the Diamond suite and president suite of Rich Palace Hotel using a promotional video",
  "abstract": "The main problem that Rich Palace Hotel is currently facing is the Diamond suites and Platinum President suites are not selling very well. The occupancy of both rooms are very low which is only 5%-8% per month. Therefore, making a promotional tool with video form would be the right solution to solve the problem. By watching promotional video customers will know more about Diamond suites and President suites, because promotional video contains information that can increase customers awareness of the The Diamond suite and President suite. It can also become the tool for the sales and marketing team to offer both rooms in order to increase the occupancy level. The video will show about the benefits of staying in Diamond Suites or Platinum President Suites compared to staying at the Deluxe room.",
