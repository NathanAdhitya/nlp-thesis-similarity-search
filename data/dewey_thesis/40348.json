  "title": "Cheated: a psychoanalysis on a transgender person",
  "abstract": "This creative works tells a story about a husband who hides his true identity from his wife. He is actually a transgender person who has a desire to be a woman, but he represses his desire and tries to live as a man. I choose the transgender topic because I believe there are a lot of transgender people around us, who are like the husband character, who repress their true sexuality because of the society norms and beliefs. Therefore, I want to explore more on this topic using the theory of defense mechanism by Freud to explain why and how the husband represses his sexuality, and to explain the effects caused by the repression. Later on, I hope that more transgender people will be able to accept their true identity. The story itself is presented through the drama genre mixed with the psychological thriller genre to suit the style of the creative work which focuses on the psychological state of the main characters and the complexity within them. The creative work itself is a screenplay that has very strong visual elements to help explain the psychological state of the characters.",
