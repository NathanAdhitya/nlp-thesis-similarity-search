  "title": "The Study of points of view in Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway",
  "abstract": "This thesis is an analysis of the use of the stream of consciousness method of narration in Virginia Woolf's Mrs. D a ll o w a v . The use of the stream of consciousness point of view in the novel is revealed through the three important incidents in the central character's life. Those are Mrs. Dalloway's isolation, her love affairs, and her response to life and death. Basically, the stream of consciousness in those three incidents are represented by using narrated monologue or \"erlebte Rede\" technique, yet, there is a few interior monologue technique, too. The stream of consciousness is effective to reveal the character's inner life as the character's actions occur and develop through what is going on in the character's mind. The stream of consciousness point of view, then, is interesting and worth discussing because of its psychological approach and its identifying art of narration in modern literature.",
