  "abstract": "Sentence pattern is a structure which is considered a basic grammatical pattern for sentence. As one of the important parts of making sentence, it is very important for people to consider the sentence pattern itself which contains subject and PREDICATIVE PATTERN. The significance of PREDICATIVE PATTERNS which represent sentence pattern, together with COMMUNICATIVE FUNCTIONS shows the structural meaning of a text. Hillary Duff songs are considered to be popular pop songs. The writer made an attempt to describe the structural meaning of the songs. She used PREDICATIVE PATTERNS which represent sentence patterns together with COMMUNICATIVE FUNCTIONS to describe three of Hillary Duff songs, `Hide Away?, `The Getaway?, and `Cry?. For the analysis, the writer uses Norman C. Stageberg & Dallin D. Oaks (2000) and Enno Klammer (1977) theories. As a result, she found that the most predominant of Predicative Pattern in some of Hillary Duff songs is pattern V (transitive verb + noun). She also found the most predominant communicative function in the songs is information. As the conclusion, she found that there is a structural system in the lyrics of pop songs.",
