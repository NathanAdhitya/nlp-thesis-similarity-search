She examines whether the Politeness Principle works or does not work , in other words can give explanations of violations of the Cooperative Principles. The writer focuses on the viblation of Cooperative Principles. So, she does not analyse any dialogues where a11 maxims of the Cooperative Principles are obeyed. The writer uses qualitative approach to analyse the utterances of some American politicians , and the single issue in the discourse is the recent US activity in Haiti.
