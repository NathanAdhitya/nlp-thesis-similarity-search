  "title": "A Study of the main female character's \"virginity\" as seen in D. H. Lawrence's The Virgin and The Gipsy",
  "abstract": "In D. H. Lawrence?s The Virgin and The Gypsy, the main female character, Yvette, is a virgin who feels unsatisfied with her life and experiences several conditions that finally make her lose her virginity mentally. The problems that I want to discuss are in what way Yvette is a virgin, what make her lose her virginity, and how she has changed after she has lost her virginity. To discuss the topic about Yvette?s virginity, I use literary theory such as characterization and conflict besides the concept of virginity to analyze the topic. In the analysis, I analyze that Yvette?s virginity in correlation with the will, unconsciousness, and sexuality. She experiences several conditions that make her lose her virginity that influence Yvette?s change. After she has lost her virginity, I see that there is change that she becomes a person who can assert her individuality and becomes more powerful in life.",
