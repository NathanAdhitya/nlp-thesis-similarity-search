  "abstract": "This thesis aims to reveal the interdependency between two main characters in Mark Gatiss’s Sherlock. Mark Gatiss’s Sherlock television series shows how two different people can develop a very close relationship by showing two main characters, Sherlock and John, in living their relationship. I am going to analyze Sherlock and John’s interdependency using social-psychological approach. I will use the theory of interdependency to reveal Sherlock and John's interdependency through how and why they develop their relationship. Their interdependency can be in a form of emotional needs or social needs. In discussing the interdependency, I would like to discuss Sherlock’s and John’s strategy in developing their relationship by using the concept of reward and cost. Then, I will explain about the reasons on their relationship’s development because of their will in getting the maximum reward from their relationship. Also, I find that they cannot find another relationship which gives them the same outcome. In conclusion, I find out that Sherlock and John have their outcomes or rewards which can be achieved only in their relationship. Also, in achieving the outcome both of them have to bear the consequence. I also find that both Sherlock and John have a big dependency toward each other.",
