  "abstract": "This thesis is an analysis of Ivanov's character and conflicts in Chekhov's Ivanov. The writer wants to analyze Ivanov's character and conflicts which lead him to his tragic life. In discussing Ivanov's tragic end the writer analyzes his character in chapter III and followed by both his outer and inner conflicts in chapter IV. It is important to study his character first before studying his conflicts so the reader can know how and what he is. Through the character analysis the writer can conclude that Ivanov's pride and self-realization lead him to his tragic end. Besides, he experiences outer and mostly inner conflicts in which he is pushed down into false action. Through his inner struggle he comes to realize about his worthlessness of life. In short, at the end of the play, Ivanov makes a decision to commit suicide. By doing that he gets his pride again.",
