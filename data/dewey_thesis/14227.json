  "title": "A Study of eugene's pressures and his release from his isolation and pressures in Thomas Wolfe's look homeward, angel",
  "abstract": "This thesis is about Eugene's isolation and pressures and his release from his isolation and pressures. I choose this topic based on my curiosity about Eugene's ability to survive although he was isolated and under pressure. I want to know what pressures Eugene has and how he can be released from them. In this thesis, I want to show Eugene's release, from an isolated and pressured boy to become a man who is successful in his life. For my methodology, I use library research to find literary and psychological theories to support my analysis of the novel. I am going to discuss Eugene's pressures, in this case they are the ones caused by his family and friends and his release from the pressures. Since Eugene is isolated and under pressure, it is difficult for him to release himself from those obstacles, because he has no self-confidence to do it Then, I find out that Eugene's self-confidence arises because of the Leonards, his teachers. From this finding, I conclude that Eugene's experience with the Leonards is the most important turning point that releases him from his isolation and pressures.",
