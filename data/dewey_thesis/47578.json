  "abstract": "Codes or dialects are the most important factor in society to communicate every day. In a society, a person acquires and learns the particular code to get along with the community. It becomes interesting when a person can speak more than one code. This thesis is about the code-switching used by a person on several occasions with different people and codes/dialects. This thesis aims to find out the codes spoken by the subject and the social factors and dimensions of code-switching that trigger the switch. This study is qualitative research. The results show that the most frequent code spoken by the subject was Kupangnese, and the social factor that triggered the shift was the participant in relation to intimacy as the social dimension. It can be concluded that a person uses code-switching to build a sense of solidarity, especially among his friends.",
