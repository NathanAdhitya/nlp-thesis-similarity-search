  "title": "The Theme of individualism as revealed through the characters of Ibsen's plays an enemy of the people and a doll's house",
  "abstract": "Ibsen used to write about social problems in his plays. An Enemy of the People and A Doll's House are the plays which talk about the idea of individualism. An Enemy of the People presents a man who encourages his townspeople to be aware of his right and not being oppress by others. While in A Doll's House, Ibsen presents a woman who is searching for her own identity and not just a doll for her husband. Through Nora and Dr. Stockmann, Ibsen shows the characters which are strong, independent and rebellious, They are against the social condition at that time. Thus, Ibsen's such plays are hardly accepted by people at that time. But later on his realistic description of the problems of life could be accepted and being a great influence on world drama.
