  "title": "The influence of service quality dimensions towards customer loyalty with customer satisfaction as the mediator for Hokky supermarket",
  "abstract": "This research paper aims to find the relationship between service quality dimensions and customer loyalty with customer satisfaction as the Hokky supermarket mediator. This research topic was chosen, as service quality dimensions can differentiate the businesses under the retail industry, knowing that they sell homogenous goods. Moreover, the author also discussed the most dominant service quality dimensions for the Hokky supermarket, which shows the size that needs to be improved first before the other dimensions. This primary research data was gathered from the 102 respondents who participated in answering the online questionnaires and was analyzed by using IBM SPSS software. Then, there were four findings, answering the four research questions. The four results are: Empathy has the most dominant positive influence on customer satisfaction. Only empathy and responsiveness that have a significant and positive impact on customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction has a significant influence on customer loyalty. The relationship of empathy and responsiveness with customer loyalty has a full mediation effect on customer satisfaction. In contrast, the relationship between assurance and customer loyalty has a partial mediation effect on customer satisfaction.",
