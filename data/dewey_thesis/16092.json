  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of Count Cenci's hatred, cruelty, and brutality toward his own family. His hatred, cruelty, and brutality bring bad effects to his family, especially to his children. They become disobedient, rebellious, and also impolite. His family even want to take revenge on him because they consider Cenci as the oppressor or the tyrant in the family. According to the Cenci family, killing Count Cenci is the best way to end their fear and suffering. However, they take a wrong decision, and then the decision brings a bad result to them. They must go to the execution. The thesis writer analyzes the characters of Count Cenci's children to find the effects of Count Cenci's hatred, cruelty, and brutality. Finally, the writer concludes that hatred, cruelty, and brutality of Count Cenci toward his family are negative because they make the family become very sad, depressed, and suffering. Besides, the revenge of the Cenci family on the Count is also negative because it brings destruction to the family.",
