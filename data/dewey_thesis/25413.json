  "title": "The Study of Edna's character and conflicts in revealing the theme of Kate Chopin's the awakening",
  "abstract": "Chopin's The Awakening is about the struggle of Edna, the main character to get her freedom and independence. The theme of the novel is the awakening of Edna to what is missing in her marriage and her refusal to be contented. This study is to prove that this theme can be revealed through the study of Edna's character and conflicts that she faces. The thesis writer sees that Edna is persistent to get what she wants. She wants to be free, independent and herself. She has realized that she is an individual not someone else's possesion. Therefore, she needs her existence to be admitted. However, her struggle cannot be accepted during her time. That is why she is in conflicts with the society, her father and her husband. They think that she has a very odd idea wliich cannot be tolerated. Thus, the best solution that Edna takes is drawning herself to the sea where she really gets her freedom and independence.",
