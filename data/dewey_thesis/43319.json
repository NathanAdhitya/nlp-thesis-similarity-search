  "title": "Promoting SPELL ELC using a marketing booklet",
  "abstract": "SPELL ELC (Special Programs for English Language & Literacy English Language & Communication) is an English course company located in Pondok Mutiara regency blok MEA 8. This company claims their company as English School which have some subjects about English for children to adults. Also, the main problem of this company is they need to promote this course company to increase the numbers of students. For now, SPELL has around 400 students. However, the numbers of students are not stable in every term. Sometimes they got a lot of students (newcomers), and sometimes they only have a few students. At first, the solution to promote this problem was using video promotion. However, it was changed by the owner into creating new booklet after looking at the target marketâ€™s needs. The reason for creating a brochure is they can run their business by promoting the programs directly to the people. The content of the booklet is explaining the plans of the company to customers and potential customers. Therefore, this booklet can benefit the company and its customers. I use some theories to make the new booklet. Those theories are related to the brochure, such as promotion tools, marketing, booklet, and the contents of the brochure.",
