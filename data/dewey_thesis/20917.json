  "title": "The Absurdity of Beckett's waiting for Godot",
  "abstract": "This thesis is an attempt to put forward and explain specifically the absurdity of Beckett's Waiting for Godot . The representative absurd is ts Adamov,Genet,Ionesco and Beckett assume that the world is purposeless and meaningless,or absurd,then consequently such kind of world reduces the meaning of existence.This particular assumption characterizes the form of their plays.The typical dramatic elements (structure,characterization ,subject-matter and theme,and language)sum up and v i s u a l i ze the idea of absurdity of the world on stage.Thus,it is by the form and content that their plays are classified as absurd.In this case,the thesis writer chooses Beckett's Waiting for Godot,one of the absurd plays,as the object,of his study.Through the typical characteristics of structure, characterization ,subject-matter and theme,and .language,the absurdity in Waiting for Godot can be detected,for such elements represent ideas concerning the senselessness of the human condition. The structure of Waiting for Godot is flat.This is to show that life moves without a logical order .The characters are unrecognizable,comic and tied to each other (Vladimir and Estragon;Rosso and Lucky).These realities of the characters visualise the senselessness of the human condition in the world.The subject-matter and theme reveal the idea that man's existence in this absurd world is nothing.The tendency to override the function of language refers to the fact that reality in all its complexity is unspeakable and incomprehensible.Such dramatic elements are parts of Beckett's dramaturgy to make concrete the.idea of absurdity on stage.This dramaturgy will enable the spectators to catch the vision of absurdity of living superficially .",
