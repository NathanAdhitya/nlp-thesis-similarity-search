  "title": "Quality analysis of clay to biscuit using failure mode and effect analysis in PT Doulton",
  "abstract": "PT Doulton is one of the world?s leading manufactures and distributors in the premium ceramic tabletop and collectors market. Nowadays, business becomes so competitive. PT Doulton must improve the production process to keep their existence. Clay making department is one of the process in PT Doulton that is used to make clay as next process material. Clay production is largest in PT Doulton. Clay making department has so many various defects and the causes. In order to improve the process, PT Doulton must know the causes of all defects. So, PT Doulton wants to improve by solving each of the cause starting from the most important. The appropriate method is Failure Mode and Effect Analysis but unfortunately, PT Doulton is not using that method. By using Failure Mode and Effect Analysis, PT Doulton will be able to know the cause all of defect and make priority solving. Through this final project, it is expected that most of the causes can be known, the suggestion can be useful to improve the process production, and PT Doulton can learn Failure Mode and Effect Analysis.",
