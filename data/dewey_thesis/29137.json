From this study, the writer wants to find out the directive utterances in Devil Wears Prada, namely about the types of directives used by the boss and the assistant, and the differences between both of them. In addition, the writer also tries to find out the responses produced by Andrea to the boss, and the assistant. Finally, the writer would like to know the differences between both of them. The writer used the study of Ervin-Tripp (1976) as cited in Wolfson (1981) as the reference of types of directives. Besides, the study of Yule (1996) was used as a reference to reveal the kinds of responses used by Andrea.
