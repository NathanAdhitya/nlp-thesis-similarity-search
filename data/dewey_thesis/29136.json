  "abstract": "This study is about request strategies in dating invitation expressions made by the main characters in Stephenie Meyer’s novel named Twilight Saga. The research objectives are to investigate kinds of request expression the main characters used and to find out whether the gender theories are still applicable to this present study. The writer used Trosborg’s (1994) theory of request to analyze the data. Trosborg’s (1994) classifies request strategies into four main groups (Indirect request, conventionally indirect (hearer-oriented conditions), conventionally indirect (speaker-based conditions), direct request), and involving eleven sub-strategies. In conducting this research, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach since in this study; she focused on the product more than the process. From the analysis, the writer found that both female and male characters tend to use the same request strategies, namely conventionally indirect (hearer-oriented conditions) and indirect request. In her opinion, it might happen because of several reasons, such as gender equality, age, culture, intimacy, unique love life, and personality factor. Hopefully, this present study can be useful in giving an insight about request strategies in dating invitation expressions.",
