  "title": "The Meanings of lesbian relationship as seen in Alice Walker's The Color Purple",
  "abstract": "This thesis deals with the meaning of lesbian relationship that is shown through the main character, Celie. Through her lesbian relationship in The Color Purple, I want to reveal what the meanings of her lesbian relationship are. Then, to analyze the meanings of her lesbian relationship, I use the theory of slavery resistance and black feminism theory. After that, by analyzing this novel, I find out that somehow lesbian relationship is not only about the sexual orientation between women especially in the context of black lesbian relationship. By finding out the meanings of her lesbian relationship, I finally find out that she uses her lesbian relationship as a means of resistance, as a tool to know her sexuality and body, and the last, she uses her lesbian relationship as an implementation to see herself as worthy being. At last, I can conclude that lesbian relationship in the context of black lesbian relationship has several meanings for the women who get involved in it instead of just a sexual orientation between women.",
