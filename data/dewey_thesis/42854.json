  "title": "Identity transition as reflected on the body language and costumes in the danish girl",
  "abstract": "In this study, I observe to reveal the identity transition of the main character in The Danish Girl film, Einar. I would like to analyse how he changed his gender identity. In analysing the film, I used the theory of Cass identity model by Vivienne Cass. In collecting the data, I used some screenshots from the film in order to determine the identity transition stages through the costumes and body language. In the analysis, I found that Einar is a woman who trapped in man’s body. I interpret and classify the body language and costumes to the stages as mentioned in the theory, which are identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance and identity pride. The process of the changing gender identity shows that Einar deserves his new identity. This also means that body language and costumes are important in influencing the audience’s perspective to determine the identity of a character",
