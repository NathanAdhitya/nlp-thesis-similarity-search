  "title": "A Study of Shimamura's relationship with Komako and the factors behind it in Kawabata's snow country",
  "abstract": "The study is about the relationship between Shimamura and Komako in the snow country. The main male character in Snow Country, Shimamura, has an affair with the geisha in the hot-spring village in the snow country, Komako. Shimamura is said to be incapable to love, but after he meets Komako, he keeps coming back to the snow country to see her. This becomes the reason of the study to find out what kind of relationship occurs between them and what factors are behind it. To find out the relationship between Shimamura and Komako and the factors behind the relationship, I apply literary approach, using the literary theory of characterization and the related psychological theories. The finding shows that the relationship cannot grow further than romantic and then it stops since only passion controls Shimamura. The factors behind is Shimamura's own characteristics as a hedonist and egoist who cannot love. I conclude that the doomed relationship between Shimamura and Komako shows passion, and sometimes intimacy, but not the long lasting love.",
