  "title": "The Causes of Anna Karenina's suicide as seen in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina",
  "abstract": "Toltstoy's Anna Karenina is a very interesting story for the writer, and is as famous as its author, Leo Tolstoy. The writer is curious about the reasons of the tragic death of Anna Karenina in the story. Therefore, this thesis is about the causes of Anna Karenina's suicide. To identify the causes of suicide, the writer uses the theory of conflict. Anna experiences both external conflicts and internal conflicts within her married life, her love affair, and her life in the society. The analysis proves that Anna cannot solve all her problems, those are her unfulfilled expectation, her attachment to her son, her fear for loving Vronsky, her inability to withstand the society's judgement and her dilemma. The conclusion is that Anna cannot solve all her conflicts and this causes her self-destruction. Therefore, she decides to commit suicide.",
