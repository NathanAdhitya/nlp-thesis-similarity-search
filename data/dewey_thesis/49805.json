  "title": "Golden: a musical screenplay reworking the psychosocial maldevelopment of the obedient kid",
  "abstract": "It is common for people to assume that if a child behaves well, they will grow well. However, apparently this kind of child might harbour self-doubt, a strong sense of guilt, and a weak ego identity which will bring them problems emotionally and socially. This creative work, Golden, intends to raise discussions on this issue by trying to give possible answers on how children may end up developing these traits, what the effect of these traits are, and how to recover, all based on Erik Erikson’s eight stages of psychosocial development theory. The work itself, written as a musical screenplay, follows the maturation of an obedient daughter, Annisa, who felt the need to stay good to please her mother. However, her obedience eventually got her into trouble and, after facing more obstacles, she almost decided to run away. Based on the work, Annisa ended with “guilt” during play age because of how her mother raised her. The effect is she lacked emotional resilience especially in an initiative-based environment. However, she eventually achieved balance and recovered by enduring confrontations and growing a sense of trust. Due to the focus on emotion and growth, this work falls under the genre coming-of-age drama.",
