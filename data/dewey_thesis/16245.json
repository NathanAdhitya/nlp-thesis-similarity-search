  "abstract": "In Hard Times, Charles Dickens attempts to show how parents' attitudes influence their children. In this novel, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Gradgrind and also their son, Tom, try to persuade Louisa to accept the marriage proposal from Mr. Bounderby. In this study, the thesis writer will analyze the factors that influence the Gradgrinds' attitudes in persuading Louisa to accept the marriage proposal and Louisa's factors in accepting the proposal. Besides, the thesis writer will also discuss the consequences of their attitudes. By using literary approach, which is characterization and by knowing the condition of the society and also the women and the young women in the Victorian era, the thesis writer may find out those factors and the consequences they get. From the analysis, the thesis writer finds out that money is the biggest factor that influences the Gradgrinds in persuading Louisa, and as the consequence, because of the absence of pure love, the four people live unhappily.",
