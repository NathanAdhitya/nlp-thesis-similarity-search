  "abstract": "A Conventional control system has a local monitor system. It monitors condition of the control system such as present value and setting point. Nowadays, a modern control system has a remote monitor system that can monitor the conditions remotely. For this purpose, control system can use computer network for its communication line. This final project discuss about a remote control system. The system uses AT89C52 microcontroller and fuzzy logic control method. Ethernet controller CS8900A is added to the system in order to communicate in a computer network. The system is tested by monitoring it remotely in an active computer network. Monitor system reads the present value of the fuzzy logic controller and gives a setting point value. The test gave a good result, the system can be monitored and controlled remotely with an acceptable error ratio.",
