  "title": "A Study on the factors that lead to Amit and Dimple's failures in their marriage as seen in Bharati Mukherjee's wife",
  "abstract": "This paper deals with marriage failure found in Bharati Mukherjee?s novel Wife, observed through the main characters, Amit Basu and Dimple Dasgupta as husband and wife. The thesis writer is interested in finding the factors that causes their marriage to fail. Through the analysis, he finds out there are two factors that lead their marriage to fail, the external factor and the internal factor. The external factor is the cultural shock they suffered when they move from Calcutta to New York and the internal factor is from their emotional inner conflicts towards each other. The significant internal factor is Amit?s ignorance of understanding his wife?s feelings, that accumulates into dissapointment, dissatisfaction and frustration that eventually explodes in the form of Dimple?s act of murdering her husband. The thesis writer uses two literary theories as the tools for analyzing this novel, characterization and conflict. As this novel is in the sphere of Indian culture, he uses Kama Sutra?s theory of marriage as supporting tool.",
