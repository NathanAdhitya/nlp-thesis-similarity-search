  "title": "Cognitive learning styles used by male and female students in grade 10 of natural science of \"X\" school in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "This study identified male and female’s cognitive learning styles and found out the similarities and differences between male and female’s cognitive learning styles. The study’s theoretical framework is from Ehrman (1996) on Cognitive Learning Styles. The subjects of this study were 26 10th-grade-science-students of “X” school, a private school in Surabaya. This study used a mixed-method approach to find out the students’ cognitive learning styles. The quantitative approach was employed when the researcher distributed questionnaires adapted from Ehrman and Leaver (2002b) to the students. The qualitative approach was applied when the researcher interviewed five male and three female students. The overall findings suggested that male students were categorized as concrete learners and female students as analogue learners. Furthermore, the results showed that there were five similarities and differences between male and female students’ cognitive learning styles. Additionally, these findings can be used by English teachers to conduct activities inside the classroom based on male and female students’ cognitive learning styles.",
