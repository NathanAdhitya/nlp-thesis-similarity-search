  "title": "Speech acts in GEICO’s short stories and nursery rhymes advertisement",
  "abstract": "To be able to create an emotional connection through advertisement is very important. GEICO Insurance company, a famous insurance company from the United States has realized that. It evokes the audiences’ nostalgic feelings by adapting and reconstructing famous nursery rhymes and short stories as their advertisements’ storyline. In this study, the writer has analysed the visual and the verbal data from four of its 2010 advertisement campaign using speech acts theories. The illocutionary acts that are found in the advertisements are representatives (16), followed by expressives (4), and the least used is directives (4). Through the speech acts and the visuals GEICO wants to persuade the audiences to emotionally believe in their company and hopefully use their insurance service. From this study, the writer wants to say that through constructing and formulating the words in adaptation of literary works can create powerful speech force to persuade the audiences.",
