  "title": "The Idea of goddess as seen in Stephen King's Misery",
  "abstract": "Stephen King?s Misery portrays a story about a male writer named Paul Sheldon who is kept Annie Wilkes. In his work, Annie Wilkes is described as a psycho woman. In Misery, Paul Sheldon always refers Annie Wilkes as a goddess. This is contradictory with the stereotype of goddess which is commonly believed. Thus, in this study I would like to analyse about the idea of goddess as portrayed through Annie Wilkes. Furthermore, I will use mythological approach in order to reveal the idea of goddess. Through the mythological approach, I find there are some concepts of archetypal mother that can be related to Annie Wilkes. Through the concept, I find that goddess is not only about positive aspects such as life bringer, nurturer, and a protector; but goddess can also be about negative aspects such as fear bringer, absolute ruler, and a punisher. In the end of the study, it can be said that Annie Wilkes represents goddess with the duality aspects because she fulfils negative and positive aspects. In other words, Annie Wilkes can represent a positive goddess with such characteristics as life bringer, protector, and nurturer. On the contrary, she can also represent a negative goddess with characteristics such as fear bringer, punisher, and absolute ruler.",
