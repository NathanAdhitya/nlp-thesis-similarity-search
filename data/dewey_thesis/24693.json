  "title": "Re-layout at Raffles production line PT Schneider Electric Manufacturing Batam using line architecture design methodology",
  "abstract": "PT Schneider Electric Manufacturing Batam is a global company that specializes in energy management, energy control, and energy efficiency which operates in many countries. One of the company branches at Asia region is SEMB (Schneider Electric Manufacturing Batam). SEMB has two production plants, one of SEMB plants produce timer products for energy controller. Timer product has several production lines and one of them is Raffles production line. Among others production line, Raffles has the lowest productivity and there are also a lot of waste which affects the production line efficiency. Then the company stated the continuous monitors and improvement to all production lines. Productivity indicator, KE (Koeficient Efficiency) for Raffles at January - August 2009 is 56%. This final thesis is proposed to increase the KE level. Line Architecture Design Methodology (LADM) is a method that is used to evaluate the production line and to analyze the improvements action to increase KE value. LADM evaluation result is to re-layout the production line and to renew the material and product flow. The KE value increases to 72% after the implemented for only 10 days, i.e. the KE is increasing 16%. Therefore, it can be concluded that the project objective is achieved.",
