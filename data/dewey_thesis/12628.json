  "abstract": "Anthony Trollope is a novelist, biographist, short story writer, and travel books writer. He writes so many books and his famous books are the Barsetshire series. The Small House at Allington is the fifth book of this series. It draws social and political setting together, reintroducing the good and the not so good who people Barsetshire. Trollope's chronicles of Barsetshire reach maturity in this novel. It has all the characters of the first until the fourth book and the setting consist of the social and political life of the community. Some conditions in the novel show that he is concerned about the condition in the society in his time. He is especially concerned about the socio-economic classes and their characteristics. The writer of this thesis analyzes the novel base on character approach and on readings on Victorians especially about their ideas and attitudes toward prosperity. Thus, in order to prove the similar conditions between the novel and real life, the writer uses the character of Crosbie. Crosbie's money orientation, perception about prosperity, urges the writer to write about him for her thesis. The writer hopes by proving that Crosbie represents the real condition and becomes a satirical subject, the reader gets a brief picture that wrong ideas about prosperity can destroy people's life.",
