  "abstract": "In this study, the writer investigated the word-formation processes used by the officers of TNI-AD for their presentation slides. The theory of word-formation processes proposed by Chaer (2003, pp. 169-193) was used as the main theory of this research. Descriptive qualitative approach supported by quantitative data was employed for this study. The result of the analysis showed that pemendekan (clipping) process was the only word-formation process occurred (87.27%). Apart from four major word-formation processes proposed by Chaer (2003, pp. 169-193), there were also some words that specifically formed by clipping the original word and adding the apostrophe afterward. (2.77%). It can be concluded that the military officers prefer to use simple, short, and easily remembered word to describe something. Thus, they try to write words which are considered simpler and more practical than the original word(s).",
