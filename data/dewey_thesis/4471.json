  "abstract": "This thesis discusses one of Edith Wharton's novels, the reef. It talks about the main male character, whose name is George Darrow, who betrays his fiancee. In the betrayal of George Darrow, there are some causes and effects. The effects and causes of George Darrow's betrayal become the point that the thesis writer wants to analyze in this discussion. Literary approaches, which consist of literary theories such as conflicts and characterization, are used to help the thesis writer in doing the analysis on George Darrow's betrayal. By using the theory of characterization, it is found out that George Darrow commits his betrayal because of the inner and outer factors. The inner factors are George Darrow's prejudice of Anna Leath's rejection and his pity toward Sophy Viner. The outer factors are Anna Leath's and Sophy Viner's personality. By using the theory of conflict, it is found out that George Darrow's betrayal makes the life of Anna Leath as his fiancee and Owen Leath become unhappy. Through the analysis, the thesis writer finds out that are inner and outer factors which cause George Darrow's betrayal toward Anna Leath and the betrayal itself lead to the unhappy life of Anna Leath and Owen Leath.",
