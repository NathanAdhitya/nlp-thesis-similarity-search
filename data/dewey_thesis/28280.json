  "abstract": "Manga is one of the Japanese literary works that becomes popular because of the pictures that describe the condition of the characters and the storyline of the book. For young people, manga can be read more easily than the other kinds of books. Meanwhile, shounen is one type of manga, that is marketed to young men. Fairy Tail is the book that I chose to be analyzed because I am interested in one of the Fairy Tail 's characters, Erza Scarlet. I am interested about her struggles to gain equality on the community which is dominated by the patriarchal system. In this thesis, I try to reveal the way Erza Scarlet struggles to gain equality. Erza Scarlet is enslaved by the patriarchal system but now she struggles to gain the equality. I am going to use the concept of liberal feminism that mostly talks about the female's struggles on the community to get the equality and freedom. Joining the guild that is led by the male leader, Erza seeks equality between her and the other guild members. She also struggles outside the guild in order to get the equality. Moreover, I find that there is actually another goal that Erza wants to achieve after she gets the equality, which is the same rights and oportunities on the community. Thus, based on that goal, she has to get the equality. In conclusion, Erza Scarlet is able to get the equality.",
