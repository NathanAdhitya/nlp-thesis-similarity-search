  "abstract": "This paper is about my screenplay entitled Finding Andy which I use as my final project. The screenplay itself is a story about a teenage girl who wants to improve her family’s poor communication. For my theory, I use Gottman’s “The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Model” about family conflict. The theory helps me to shape my characters’ behavior towards each others. Since my characters has better relationship even though the brother dies in the end, I tend to use the worst level of family conflict in the beginning of the story and it gradually changes into successful communication. The theory helps me to give example of family’s poor communication to the audiences. I also do an observation on some families with poor communications. I expect that the creative work is made into films, like what screenplay is for, so that the audiences realize that this kind of family exists.",
