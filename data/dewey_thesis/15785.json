  "abstract": "Nowadays, the Toyota Kijang Diesel body construction is still using separated body construction and it is enable to carry out improvement to become semi monocoque chassis construction especially in order to improve the aspects of vehicle stability will be archieved by striving for the reduction of vehicle's center of gravity by means of chassis structure modification. The chassis structure in semi monocoque chassis construction is different from the one in separated body. Commonly, the chassis frame in separated body is in the shape of perimeter, which forms like frame around the underneath edge of the vehicle, and the body of vehicle is put on the frame.
