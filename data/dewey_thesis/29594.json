  "title": "A Video guidelines on handling complaints: a solution for the receptionists lack of English communication skills at the Alana Hotel Surabaya",
  "abstract": "During my internship at a serviced apartment, I found that the front officers there had difficulties in handling foreign guestsâ€™ complaints. This problem led to a more serious problem, that is, customer dissatisfaction. When the guests are dissatisfied, they can find other hotels to stay. Thus, the best solution for this problem is a video guideline which contains the steps and procedures in handling complaints from foreign guests. The video guideline on handling complaints from foreign guests will show the front officers how to handle complaints about room facilities and services and situations at a hotel. They also will learn how to apologize and how to thank the guests in English appropriately. In order for me to finish this project, I did several steps: choosing the topic for the video guideline, creating the role play situations, writing the scripts, doing the rehearsals, and performing the role play.",
