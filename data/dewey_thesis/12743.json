  "title": "A Study on the characterization of Beowulf to reveal the pagan of christian elements in Beowulf",
  "abstract": "This thesis takes Beowulf\", one of the oldest English works, as the subject of the discussion. As some other pieces of literature, Beowulf also reflects the condition of the society at that period, that is the Anglo-Saxons who believed in both Paganism and Christianity. The two beliefs are also found not only in the poem, but also in Beowulf's characters. Since Beowulf's characters shows both pagan and Christian elements, the thesis writer wants to reveal both the pagan as well as the Christian elements in Beowulf's characters. Therefore, a literary theory on the characterization is required in the analysis. Then, to understand about paganism and Christianity, the concepts of the beliefs are also needed. With several tools, the thesis writer finds out that Beowulf is a pagan warrior who is mindful of glory, boastful and very dependent on his own ability. On the other hand, Beowulf also shows the Christian elements such as elieving in God and the Holy Bible, loving other people sincerely together with helping and serving others.",
