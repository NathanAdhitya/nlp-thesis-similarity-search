  "title": "Children picture-book series on exploring the causes of low self-esteem issues and the positive effects after overcoming them",
  "abstract": "My creative work is about self-esteem in children, and I explore the causes of low self-esteem in children and what children get after gaining their self-confidence back. To be able to write more accurately, I have used Erik Eriksonâ€™s Psychosocial Development, the concept of Praise Paradox, Body Image, and Colorism. In the first and second story, my main characters have low self-esteem because they feel unappreciated, but will later feel more loved and happy after overcoming their issues. In the third story, my main character has low self-esteem because she keeps receiving the wrong type of praise and will later be calmer after overcoming her issue. In the fourth and fifth story, my main characters have low self-esteem because of their appearances, but will then be more confident and secure after overcoming their issues.",
