  "title": "Stereotyping and othering of non-white characters in Harry Potter movies",
  "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the way the non-white characters, such as Black and Asian, are portrayed in Harry Potter movies. The non-white people are put in the group of unimportant characters. Their characters seem to be portrayed differently compared to the white characters in term of their characterizations. Using film language theory, such as body language and dialogue, I find there are Stereotyping and Othering towards the non-white characters. I analyze the Stereotyping toward non-white characters such as Cho Chang and Kingsley Shacklebolt as the Asian and Black character using the gestures, facial expression, costumes, and dialogues. I also analyze the Othering towards non-white characters such as Centaurs and Dre Head as the non-human characters using the appearance, accents, and costume. Also, the Yule Ball costume for Cho Chang and Patil twins also shows exoticism because of the races of the characters. As the conclusion, in Harry Potter movies, there is whiteness norm that shows white people as the important characters who matters in the movies. While the non-white people are the minor and supporting characters, who help the white people to achieve their goals. The non-white characters are portrayed as foreign and the ‘other’, to add some accent to the white world in the movies.",
