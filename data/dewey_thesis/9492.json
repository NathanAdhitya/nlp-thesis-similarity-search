  "abstract": "Postcolonialism engages with the dilemma in determining cultural identity. Garrett Omata, through his play S.A.M I Am attempts to reveal postcolonial problems undergone by the main character \"John Hamabata\" a Japanese descendant living in America. Since Europe becomes the dominant culture in America, John is in dilemma to maintain his identity as American or Asian. Therefore, cultural approach is appropriate in vivisecting John?s cultural identity problems. There are two reasons John wants to search for his cultural identity namely to be accepted among American Society and to solve his problems in ambivalence. In order to find his cultural identity, John does survival techniques namely adopt, adapt, and adept. In my last analysis, I find that finally John admits himself as Asian because he wants accept himself positively.",
