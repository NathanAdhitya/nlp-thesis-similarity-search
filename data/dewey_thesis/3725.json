  "abstract": "Den Haag CS is an important station in the Dutch railway. There are a lot of tracks going in and out of the station. Because of the increasing demand of rail transportation, it is necessary to add new tracks. Since the space available is very limited and there are so many tracks already existed, it is decided to build a fly-over and to use a light-train system instead of a regular train system. Because of those reasons, there will be a project called the Randstadrail project. Since the Randstadrail project covers very wide aspects, the study will be only on the alternative solution of the construction of the fly-over Rijnstraat. The study will be done by studying the preliminary design that has been done for the project, analyzing the structures used in the project, and studying the possibility of the location of the structures and the possibility of the construction methods. After calculating the possible structures for the fly-over Rijnstraat and studying the possible construction method for the fly-over Rijnstraat, there is some cost estimating for the Fly-Over Rijnstraat, for each type of the possible structures. In the end, the result of the study is a comparison table to give some impressions of each possible structure,which can best be applied depending on the priority given.",
