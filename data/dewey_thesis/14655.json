  "title": "The Lie in Arthur Miller?s The Crucible",
  "abstract": "This thesis is about the reasons and consequence of Abigail Williams? lie. It is based on Arthur Miller?s play, The Crucible, a play of the seventeenth century Puritans who were involved in witch-hunts and witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692. The main character, Abigail Williams holds an important role of everything that happened in her community. I am interested in discussing why Abigail lies and what are the consequences of her lies in the society. Asides from applying the theory of characterization and conflict, I also use the concept of lie to analyze why Abigail lies and the consequences of her lies in the society. From the analysis, I find that lie can be used by Abigail as a tool to survive and gain power. Abigail?s lie can make the court unable to see the truth and lie. A simple lie can blur the line between truth and lie. As a result, lie becomes truth. The court gives the death penalty to the innocent people and the court has to face the consequence that is being distrusted by the citizen.",
