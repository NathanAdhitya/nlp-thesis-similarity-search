  "title": "Code mixing in interview articles published in popular indonesian magazine",
  "abstract": "In this study, the writer investigated the types of code mixing used by the male and female interviewees in one of the Indonesian magazines named Popular. In addition, the differences in the use of code mixing expressed by the male and female interviewees were also examined. The theory of types of code mixing by Kachru (1982) was used as the main theory of this research. In this study, the writer used qualitative-descriptive data. He chose two male and two female interviewees in four interview articles published in Popular magazine. Then he analyzed the answers of the interviewees to find out the answers of the research questions. The result of the analysis showed that the interviewees in the magazine used three types of code mixing namely unit insertion, unit hybridization, and sentence insertion. There were two types of code mixing that they did not use namely idiom/collocation and reduplication. It was also found that male and female used similar of code mixing with no significant differences. This implied that the aspect of gender did not influence the occurrence of code mixing.",
