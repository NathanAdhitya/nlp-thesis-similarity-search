  "title": "Increasing the brand awareness of Toko Makmur Raya’s target market through a promotional video",
  "abstract": "Toko Makmur Raya is a paint shop located in Makassar. It was established in 2001 by Mr. Yuliadi. The shop provides paints and equipment for renovating or building. The store’s target markets are forepersons, house owners, and developers. Those three frequently visit the store and become loyal customers of the store. As one of the biggest stores in Makassar, Toko Makmur Raya has competitors which provide similar products such as wall paint and jamb paint. Another problem is that Toko Makmur Raya does not have strong branding to attract the target market. Therefore, in order to win the competition, Toko Makmur Raya needs to increase its brand awareness. To make that happen, the writer provides a solution which is a promotional video. In making the promotional video, the writer uses the theory of branding, target market, Unique Selling Point (USP), promotion, and promotional video. After finding out three USPs of the store that is: complete, affordable, and excellent services, those were highlighted in the promotional video. A promotional video can benefit the store because it can reach a larger audience by uploading the video to social platforms. Hopefully, the solution can increase the customer's brand awareness and increase sales.",
