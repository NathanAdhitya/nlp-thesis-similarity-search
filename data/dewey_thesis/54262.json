  "abstract": "This research was conducted to develop Employee Value Proposition (EVP) survey to know the reason why the employees at PT. X chooses to stay. It is also used to help PT X retains more top talents. The Employee Value Proposition (EVP) survey is a tool to measure employees’ value/tendency toward the five attributes (Compensation, Benefits, Career, Work Content, and Affiliation). The survey uses a rank type of questionnaire to get the answers from the respondents. To create the most appropriate and proper EVP survey, trials must be done which consisted of user verification and a statistical test in the form of a validity test. The type of validity test is convergent validity, using the Pearson correlation test. The validity test is conducted on all items (questions) of the survey, using computational assistance from SPSS software. Furthermore, user verification is carried out to decide whether the Employee Value Proposition (EVP) survey meets the company’s needs. The outcome of this paper later can give the company a clear description of the EVP for every employee at PT. X. It can also help the company to make decisions and strategies for retaining top talents.",
