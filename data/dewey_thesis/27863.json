  "abstract": "This thesis deals with the anxieties experienced by the female character in The Twilight Saga: New Moon, Bella. Through her anxieties in The Twilight Saga: New Moon, I want to reveal what the causes of her anxieties are and how she overcomes them. To analyze the causes of her anxieties, I use two of the theory of anxiety, that are reality and neurotic anxiety. I find out that somehow people are trying to escape from their anxieties. There are two causes that make Bella suffer from anxiety, they are insecure environment and traumatic experience. By finding out the causes of her anxieties, I find that Bella uses some ways to overcome her anxiety. She uses four defense mechanisms, which are denial, sublimation, acting out, and fixation. Bella denies her reality anxiety by denying her loneliness in the insecure environment. Besides, she uses acting out in order to release her reality anxiety and convert it to pleasure and satisfaction. Then she sublimates her anxiety into something useful, through studying. She is also fixating her anxiety to overcome both her reality and neurotic anxiety.",
