  "title": "The Perceived meaning of various fast foods slogans and the reasons based on the background knowledge among the fast foods costumers in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "This study observes the perceived meaning and the role of background knowledge of the fast foods customers. Perceived meaning itself is created from the background knowledge of people and is stored in their mind and if someday they hear about something, they have memory in their mind and they can frame it. The writer analyzed the perceived meaning based on schemata theory from George Yule?s theory (1996). The writer uses qualitative approach to analyze the perceived meaning and their role of background knowledge in fast food advertisements slogans because the data used consisted of words, not numbers. From this study, it is found that the perceived meaning and the role of background knowledge of each person are very important because through the customer?s meaning, we know that the slogans? meaning is transmitted or not. Through this analysis the writer expects that the result will help the readers have better understanding about the perceived meaning and the role of background knowledge of the fast foods advertisement slogans.",
