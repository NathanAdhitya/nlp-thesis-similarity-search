  "title": "Managing Jasapindah.id Instagram account to increase its brand awareness",
  "abstract": "Jasapindah.id is a relocation service under PT 3 Permata Logistics management. Jasapindah.id was established in 2016 and had three branches in Jakarta, Semarang, and Surabaya. They provide relocation, packing, and warehouse services, which are supported by professional and experienced manpower. However, the main problem that Jasapindah.id faced was the ineffective use of the social media of Instagram for its promotional strategy. The current Instagram contents were not good because the information needed was not complete, the quality of the picture was low, and the content was not updated regularly. Hence, the solution was managing its Instagram account by giving comprehensive information, improving the quality of the pictures, and making the content schedules to increase its brand awareness. I improved the Instagram contents and pictures based on the theories from Walter and Gioglio (2014) and Simone (2013). After I managed the account for eleven weeks, brand awareness has increased, as proved by the increasing number of followers and accounts who contacted Jasapindah.id through direct messages and comments. Hopefully, the revised Instagram contents can increase the brand awareness of Jasapindah.id and lead to better sales.",
