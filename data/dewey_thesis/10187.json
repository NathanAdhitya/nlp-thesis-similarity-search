Anxiety that ispainful emotional experience representing a threat or danger to the person appearsin one of her novels, The Romance of the Forest. Ann Radcliffe tries to applyanxiety specifically to the main character, Adeline. The misfortunes that she getsfrom her childhood up to her adulthood trigger her to overcome her anxiety bydeveloping principal methods of mechanisms. Since this work discusses theproblem dealing with anxiety, I am interested in analyzing the causes of Adeline?sanxiety are and how she overcomes it. The aim of this study is to find out thecauses of Adeline?s anxiety and Adeline?s ways to overcome her anxiety in theform of psychological approach by applying the theories of anxiety, displacement,sublimation and defense mechanisms of the ego especially repression by SigmundFreud. In all, it is clear that through this analysis, it can be concluded that eventhough anxiety overwhelms Adeline?s mind, she enables to survive andtranquilize by developing repression, displacement and sublimation.",
