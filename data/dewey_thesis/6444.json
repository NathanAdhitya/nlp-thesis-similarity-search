This phenomenon becomes the writer?s interest in doing a study on the use of loan words that come from English found in Indonesian Cosmopolitan magazine. This is a qualitative study, in which the writer analyzes the word formations, phonological and spelling changes of loan words. She collects the data from the articles ?Cover Stories? section only from Indonesian Cosmopolitan magazine issued in October 2004 and April 2005. The writer applies theory of word formation and assimilation proposed by Godby, et al (1982), theory of meaning as reference and meaning as context and use proposed by Frawley (1992). The writer also uses system of Indonesian?s Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan (2001) and Pedoman Pembentukan Istilah (1988) as the standard guidelines of the use of correct and good Indonesian language. The first thing the writer does in her analysis is identifying loan words that come from English, then, classifying their word formations. Next, she analyzes the meanings seen from dictionary entries. The writer finds out that suppletion, one type of word formation does not occur in her analysis. Most loan words in the analysis follow the two standard guidelines.",
