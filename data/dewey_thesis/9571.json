  "abstract": "This thesis deals with the figures of speech in songs, especially christian songs. The writer is interested in analyzing the figures of speech because many christian songs made by using figures of speech in order to convey the messages for God. In this research, the writer wants to know what figures of speech are used in the songs of Giving My Best?s, a youth christian band. This study is conducted using the theories of figures of speech based on Perrine (1987) and Keraf (1984).The writer uses a qualitative approach because her data were in the form of words. Finally, the writer found that Metaphor is the most frequent figure of speech that the song writer uses in order to emphasize the meaning that he actually means. Metaphor is highly selected by the song writer to explain something abstract (e.g. God, love, sin, etc) by using the concrete things.",
