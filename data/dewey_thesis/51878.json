  "abstract": "Politeness plays an essential role to keep a conversation going well for each other. People must consider the choice of words during the conversation in order to deliver the idea or opinion. This study is aimed to find out the type of politeness strategies applied by the main character in The Pakai Hati web series, which was released in 2020. In conducting this study, the writer used Brown and Levinsonâ€™s (1987) politeness theory in analyzing the utterances spoken by the main character when conversing with his boss and his colleagues as the subjects of this study. There are four politeness strategies proposed by Brown and Levinson (1987): Bald on record, Positive politeness, Negative politeness, and Off record. In addition, this study was done using a qualitative research method. The findings reveal that there are some strategies not found in the selected data source: Bald on record and Offrecord. The politeness strategies used by the main character of The Pakai hati web series are Positive and Negative politeness strategies. There are totally 15 utterances spoken by Bagas when conversing with his boss and colleagues. Positive politeness is the most used politeness strategy in the web series.
