  "title": "Promoting Fave Hotel's Rungkut meeting rooms and rooms using a marketing booklet",
  "abstract": "Fave Hotel Rungkut is a 3 â€“ star hotel, located in Jl. Kaliraya Rungkut No. 23-25. Fave Hotel Rungkut has 175 total rooms with 169 standard rooms and six suite rooms. They also offer four medium meeting rooms and two meeting rooms. Their main competitors are Cleo Business Hotel, Zest Hotel Jemursari, and Amaris Magarejo. The main problem that Fave Hotel Rungkut is facing is the decline of upselling rooms and meeting rooms in September-November 2018. To solve the problem, I made a marketing booklet to help the sales team sell the products of Fave Hotel Rungkut. A marketing booklet is made in English and Indonesia to make their local and foreign customers understand. The booklet emphasizes its USP, which is the price and location. The reason for making a marketing booklet is because it will be useful and helpful for the sales and marketing team to promote or show their products to their target market. The benefits that the company will get is the sales team use it as their sales kit when showing their products and other departments in Fave Hotel Rungkut can use it as product knowledge if they become a representative in the exhibition.",
