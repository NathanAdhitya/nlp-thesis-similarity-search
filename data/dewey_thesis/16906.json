  "abstract": "This research was undertaken by the summary writer to evaluate the topic of Dimensions of Brand Personality. This research wanted to measure the five brand personality dimensions (Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication and Ruggedness) so a reliable, valid and generaiizable measurement scale would be created. The data was obtained from U.S. Bureau of the Census as identified in 1997. In this research, a framework of brand personality dimensions is developed. The research used Likert scale (to determine the extent to which a brand can be described by certain human characteristics), principal components analysis, a varimax rotation scheme and an unrestricted number of factors to analyze individually, test-retest correlations and Cronbach's Alpha to determine the degree to which the five brand personality dimensions will yield consistent icsulls and reliability. The research showed that brand personality-framework and scale developed have important implications for researchers examining the perceptions of brand personality across cultures and the summary writer suggest that research not used a lot of methods.",
