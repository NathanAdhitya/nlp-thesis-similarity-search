  "title": "The capital structure determinants of Indonesia publicly listed firms",
  "abstract": "A corporation should be able to manage the capital structure to compete and survive in unpredictable economic circumstances. This research aims to investigate the influence of capital structure determinants (profitability, firm size, tangibility, and growth opportunity) towards capital structure decision in 138 Indonesia publicly listed firms from the period of 2009-2013 using multiple regression model. This research suggests that profitability, firm size, and growth opportunity statistically have a significant influence on corporate leverage. On the other hand, tangibility does not have a substantial impact on capital structure decision. Profitability and firm size indicate a negative influence on corporate hold that support pecking order theory. In contrast, the negative relationship between growth opportunity and corporate leverage is aligned with static trade-off theory and agency cost theory.",
