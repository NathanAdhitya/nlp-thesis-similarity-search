Therefore, in this thesis, the thesis writer is eager to know the reasons and the results of Pecola?s suffering. She uses the theory of characterization and the theory of conflict to analyze the reasons and the results of Pecola?s suffering. She finds out that her suffering is due to her physical problems: her being ugly, black, and poor, and her physiological problem: her being unloved. All those problems cause her into insanity.",
