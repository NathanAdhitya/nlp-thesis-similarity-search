  "title": "The other: exploring the life of an intersex individual in a stigmatizing and discriminating society",
  "abstract": "This creative thesis aims to show the effects of stigma and discrimination on intersex individuals and how they can lessen the impact of stigma and discrimination through a screenplay titled The Other. I apply the stigma theory as the main foundation of the creative work and the idea of self-acceptance as the resolution. Utilizing the genre drama and the conventions of modern youth films, I employ the main characterâ€™s suffering and contentment accordingly to highlight the detrimental consequences of stigma and the psychological gain of self-acceptance. The Other follows Alexander Wijaya, then 16 years old, a boy who begins self-discovery after discovering his intersexuality. As he faces bullying and other grievances, Alex starts to self-doubt and feels ashamed and isolated. Later, Alex realizes his worth and retrieves his confidence after accepting his body the way it is.",
