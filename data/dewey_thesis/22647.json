  "abstract": "This study aims to discuss the social oppression in Arundhati Roy?s The God of Small Things. The oppression is experienced by Indian women because India is a patriarchal society. For this reason, I am discussing how the two Indian women, Ammu and Mammachi, experience the social oppression and how they react to that oppression. The purpose of the analysis is to discuss the oppression that Ammu and Mammachi experience and their reaction to the oppression. The significance of the study is to show that patriarchal values that are abused can turn into a social oppression. The concept of oppression by Simone de Beauvoir is used to analyze the statement of the problem. The analysis shows that social oppression can be seen in the form of domestic violence. Moreover, the analysis also shows that Ammu and Mammachi have different reaction although they experience the same oppression. Ammu prefers to resist the oppression and Mammachi prefers to show the passive action because of her internalization of the patriarchal values. In the end, it can be concluded that it is very difficult to Ammu and Mammachi to escape from the social oppression because of the strong patriarchal values.",
