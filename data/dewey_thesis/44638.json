  "title": "The survivors: self-determination and how it helps youngsters to face the challenges at the work place",
  "abstract": "My screenplay the survivors follows a story of three young interns named Clara, Sebastian and Bakti in their journey during the internship program held by a famous e-commerce company, f-on-line!. Having not enough experience working in a company, the interns have a hard time to survive in the company. Moreover, the three also have non-work related problems which make things even more difficult for them. Luckily, during the program, these interns learn about self-determination. Being self-determined itself means that the interns are able to motivate themselves from the inside, do things by their own initiative, and also decide things that are fitted for their moral or values. To show that point in the screenplay, I use Deci & Ryanâ€™s self-determination theory and connect the theory specifically to work-life context. I would like to show the importance of self-determination for youngsters in facing the challenges in the workplace and how can they actually gain self-determination. The genre of the screenplay is a dramedy (drama-comedy) because it shows what usually happens to youngsters in a workplace then filled it with humour so that it can be entertaining.",
