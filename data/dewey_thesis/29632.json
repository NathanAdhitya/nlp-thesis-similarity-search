  "abstract": "This study is about the implementation of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) Approach in the English Conversation class of eighth grade in S Secondary School. The aims of this study are to find out the principles of CLT implemented in the class and the problems faced by the teacher. The study was conducted by class observation and interviews with the teacher. The main theories used are the principles of CLT by Larsen-Freeman (2000) and problems in implementing CLT by Brown (2001), supported by four categories of the difficulties in implementing CLT by Li (1998) as cited in Ozsevik (2010). The findings showed there were five principles that were not used, namely using discourse language, being a facilitator, setting social context, having communicative interaction, and producing different utterances. Moreover, the main problem faced come from students’ side: students’ low English proficiency, students’ passive style of learning, students’ resistance to participate in communicative classroom activities, and their lack of motivation for developing communicative competence. In conclusion, CLT could be considered a suitable approach to promote communicative competence as long as the teacher and the students are well-prepared.",
