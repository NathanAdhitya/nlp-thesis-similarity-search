  "title": "Increasing brand awareness of Keka Catering through social media \"Instagram\"",
  "abstract": "This creative thesis is to solve the problem that KeKa Catering has. KeKa Catering is different from the general catering, which serves the menu daily and has the same menu. However, KeKa Catering has different menus: Banjarmasinâ€™s foods and snacks. Its problem is that many people still do not recognize their brand or product. Even though KeKa Catering has already had its promotional tool, Instagram, the catering does not use it properly. That is why developing their Instagram account is the best way. It will cost less than a marketing booklet or other promotional tools. There were 12 pieces of content on their Instagram account. The customer of KeKa Catering is around 25 until 35 years old. That is why I used slang or internet words to choose a language. The target customers are broader, and many people will recognize them easily by using Instagram.",
