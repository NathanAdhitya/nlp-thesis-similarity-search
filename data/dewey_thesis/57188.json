  "title": "Code-switching used by the owner of N store to her customers",
  "abstract": "This study drew upon the theoretical frameworks proposed by Wardhaugh (2006) and Appel and Muysken (2005) to examine the kinds and functions of code-switching employed by Mrs. EE, the owner of N Store, during her interactions with customers. This study was driven by a qualitative approach focusing particularly on Mrs. EEâ€™s utterances involving code-switching. The findings revealed that Mrs. EE engaged in both situational and metaphorical kinds of code-switching. She also employed referential, directive, expressive, phatic, metalinguistic, and poetic code-switching functions. The study concluded that the application of code-switching by Mrs. EE might be influenced by her linguistic background, the context of the conversations, and her relationship with her customers.",
