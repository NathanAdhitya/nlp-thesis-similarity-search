  "abstract": "Eleftheria Milyoti is the main character in The Forty Lounge Cafe who shows the unique way of life by living in two different worlds; the real world and the illusory world. I emphasize my research on the why there is fluid boundary in Eleftheria?s life and how the fluid boundary is revealed. To help me find the answer, I use the concept of Sigmund Freud?s Defense Mechanisms and the Characteristics of Illusion in Psychoanalysis to justify Eleftheria?s action in creating illusion which is caused by her painful life. In the study, I discover that the causes of the fluid boundary between the real world and the illusory world are Eleftheria?s failure in communication aspect, meeting social expectations and power restriction. It can be seen from Eleftheria?s ways of facing her problems in those three different aspects. In addition, I have also found out that Eleftheria?s illusion is not unhealthy. However, it works for her since it gives her happiness so she can continue her painful life.",
