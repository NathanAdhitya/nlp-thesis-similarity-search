  "title": "Code-mixing used by Putri Tanjung to people who had different statuses in Ngrobrol Sore Semaunya podcast",
  "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the types of code-mixing used by Putri Tanjung when talking to two guests in a podcast who had different statuses in society. The writer observed code-mixing types used by Putri Tanjung when she was talking to Hedi Rusdian, a non-government official who had the same status as her, and when she was talking to Erick Thohir, a government official who had a higher status than her. The writer also analyzed the similarities and differences between Putri Tanjungâ€™s code-mixing types when talking to two interlocutors with different statuses. In this study, the writer used the theory of code-mixing types by Muysken (2000) and the status scale theory by Holmes (2013). In addition, the writer used a qualitative approach in this study. The findings of this study showed that Putri Tanjung used all the code-mixing types: insertion, alternation, and congruent lexicalization when she was talking to Hedi Rusdian, while she only used two types of code-mixing: insertion, and alternation when she was talking to Erick Thohir. This can probably happen due to the status of the interlocutors, the situation of the podcast, or the fact that the host cannot find words in Bahasa that can convey the meaning he wants. More studies involving another series of podcasts are recommended for more specific proof, and the influence of other social factors or social dimensions on code-mixing is recommended for further studies.",
