  "abstract": "This thesis deals with Emily Gold’s Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and how it affects her way of viewing expectations coming from people around her. Through the analysis, I will reveal Emily Gold’s PTSD symptoms, the expectations coming from people around her, her perceptions of expectations, and the effect of her failure in fulfilling the expectations. To analyze her PTSD symptoms and her perceptions of expectations, I use the theory of PTSD, and to analyze the effects of her failure in fulfilling the expectations, I use the theory of self-injury. In the analysis, it is found that Emily’s conditions as a PTSD sufferer affects her way of viewing the expectations. She perceives the expectations as rules to be obeyed in order to prevent the truth to be revealed and also as her redemption. When she fails to fulfill the expectations, she uses self-injury as her way of shouting out the pain and to punish herself. Later, when self-injury fails to accommodate her pain and anxiety, she starts to develop thoughts to commit suicide. In conclusion, Emily’s traumatic experience, and later her mental condition as a PTSD sufferer give a tremendous impact towards.",
