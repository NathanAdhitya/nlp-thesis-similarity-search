  "title": "The Influence of TV advertisement toward consumer's attitude and project: a case study on larutan penyegar Cap Kaki Tiga product in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "The writers are interested in discussing the superiority of \"Larutan Penyegar Cap Kaki Tiga\" as a market leader in Larutan Penyegar product. Through TV advertisement, the writers want to know whether TV advertisement has influenced consumer's attitude. At this moment, audio-visual technology is more advance, and private television is increasing. This makes opportunities for companies to promote their products through television media. Television media can reach society widely, and people tend to choose and buy the products advertised on TV. It is an exciting thing to know how a big consumer's attitude and the product itself can be influenced by advertisement. The writers have conducted a survey and analysis on young professionals who care about their health. The writers use questionnaires that are spread in Surabaya and use hypothesis testing to analyze the result. Finally, measuring attitude can be a basic to know consumer's buying behavior, and it can be used for determining the positioning strategy of the product. It can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. Therefore, the writers clarify that the writers can answer questions about philosophy and conclusions from consumer behavior by considering attitude.",
