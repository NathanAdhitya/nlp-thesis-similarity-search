  "title": "Oskar Schindlers moral development in Thomas Keneallys Schindlers list",
  "abstract": "In this thesis, I will discuss about the dynamics of Oskar Schindler’s moral development. In this thesis, I use Lawrence Kohlberg’s moral development stages to reveal the development of the morality principles of Oskar Schindler. It begins with the stage where Oskar Schindler’s principles of right and wrong are much influenced by his father. In this stage Oskar’s principle of morality is implemented with Utilitarianism. And thus the trigger of the shift from one stage to another is caused by Oskar’s urge to find happiness. The flow of Oskar’s moral development begins with his obedience to his father, to an individualistic view of right and wrong, to a concern for interpersonal relationship, to a concern for social expectation, to the urge to protect basic human rights and justifying violation toward the law in the society.",
