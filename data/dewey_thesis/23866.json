  "abstract": "In this research, I observed the differences and/or the similarities between the maxims flouted by the characters in Big Bang Theory and those flouted by the characters in Office Boy which provoke humor. The data were from the dialogue lines flouted by the characters? in the two movie series. The main theories used were from Grice (1989). Furthermore, I conducted this research in qualitative approach supported by quantitative data. The findings show that the flouting of maxim of relation is the most maxim often flouted in both of the movie series. The second most flouted is the maxim of quantity. The third flouted maxim is quality. The least flouted maxim is the maxim of manner. The differences between the flouting maxims on both movie series is, on Big Bang Theory, the flouting of the maxim of quality and quantity has the same number, five times, but on Office Boy shift 2 the flouting maxim of quality and quantity that has the same number, four times. The conclusion seems to be no significant difference between the maxims flouted by the characters in Big Bang Theory and those flouted by the characters in Office Boy due to a lot of significant similarities found.",
