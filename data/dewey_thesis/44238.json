  "title": "The Impact of marketing mix on customer loyalty toward Magnum ice cream",
  "abstract": "As the ice cream industry has grown significantly, reaching double size in the last 5 years, both existing and new players compete intensely utilizing various marketing mix elements to gain more loyal customers. Magnum, the ice cream of Unilever, has been a strong player recently as it grew by approximately 10 times in 2010 and reached the revenue of more than 500 billion Rupiahs in 2011. As researcher wants to assist Magnum facing the tough competition, this research is conducted with the aim to identify the most significant marketing mix elements that influence the customer loyalty toward Magnum. Using simple random sampling method, researcher gathered the primary data from 233 people residing in Jakarta and Surabaya, who have ever purchased and consumed Magnum. The data was then analyzed using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis. As the result, researcher found that simultaneously, marketing mix has significant impact on customer loyalty toward Magnum; while individually, product is the only element that has significant impact on customer loyalty toward Magnum. Thus, researcher concluded that Unilever should focus on improving its performance on product, while still maintain its performance on price, place, and promotion, in order to further increase the customer loyalty toward Magnum.",
