  "abstract": "This thesis concerns with problems in life and the neurotic needs that Veronika has, some of which she is unable to fulfill, and the ways Veronika copes with her failures to fulfill some of them as seen in Paulo Coelho?s Veronika Decides to Die. Since neurotic needs belong to psychology, I will use psychological approach to analyze. In this case, I use the theory of neurotic needs written by Karen Horney in her book Self Analysis. In discussing Veronika?s problems and neurotic needs, I divide the analysis into two parts. The first part of the analysis discusses about Veronika?s problems and the unfulfilled neurotic needs. In this part, I also discuss that Veronika?s problems in life, that is, her inability to love and be loved, to be a professional pianist and to be herself are the causes of her several fulfilled neurotic needs. Meanwhile, the second part of the analysis discusses the ways Veronika uses her coping strategies to fulfill the unfulfilled needs, or the ways she uses in order to cope with her neurosis. In the conclusion, I find out that Veronika finally succeeds in coping with her problems and unfulfilled needs. As the result, Veronika could continue her life as what she desires.",
