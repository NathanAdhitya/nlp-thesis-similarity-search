  "abstract": "This thesis deals with Angel’s redemption in the Christian Romance novel, Redeeming Love. I want to discuss Angel’s perception of her body before her marriage and how that perception changes after her marriage to Michael. The purpose of this analysis is to analyze Angel’s perception of her body before her marriage as an empty vessel and the change of perception concerning Angel’s body into the temple of God after she was married to Michael.I will use biblical verses related and various verses in the books of Genesis, Corinthian, John, and Luke to analyze. By analyzing this novel, I find that Angel regards her body as an empty vessel before her marriage to Michael. By finding Angel’s perspective of her body before her marriage, I found that Angel uses her body and soul separation as a strategy to deal with her pain. Once she is married, Angel regards her body as the temple of God and uses her knowledge of her body as the temple of God to help others like her receive God. At last, I can conclude that the Christian romance genre can be used as tool to spread the Christian perspective about the body.",
