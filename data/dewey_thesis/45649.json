  "title": "The factor of main characters' consumer behavior in Toy Story and Toy Story 2",
  "abstract": "This thesis aims to know why the main characters of Toy Story and Toy Story 2 do excessive consumption of toys. Therefore, I will use the theory of consumer behaviour to be applied to Andy, Sid, and Al as the consumers of toys. From this theory, I want to show that consumer behaviour can be seen from internal and external traits. The internal trait means consumer behaviour is influenced by the inner side of consumers. On the other hand, the external trait means consumer behaviour is triggered by the outside factor of consumersâ€™ surroundings. I connected the analysis with consumer behaviour theory by discussing the factors which have internal and external traits that cause the main characters to have consumer behaviour. In the end, it can be concluded from Toy Story (1995), and Toy Story 2 (1999) that consumer behaviour can influence children or adult for doing excessive consumption as the consumers of toys.",
