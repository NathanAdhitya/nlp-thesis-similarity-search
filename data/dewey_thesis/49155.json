  "abstract": "KONOPA or Komunitas Noken Papua is an official trade brand registered by the Papua Legal Department and Human Rights Department since 2011 located in Graha Nendali Regency Block G, No.35, east Sentani â€“ Jayapura, Papua. KONOPA's main product is Noken, a multifunctional knotted or woven bag of Papuan. Unlike other online-based Noken sellers, KONOPA has its own production space in making Noken. However, I found that there was a lack of audience interaction in KONOPA's social media activity and the problem. After conducting an interview, the customers were mainly not interested in discovering the information KONOPA provided. Therefore, it is necessary to update the ways to increase consumer engagement. These works would help the organization drawback the customers' attention and buy the products. Based on the final result and the solved problem, the average audience interaction has increased.",
