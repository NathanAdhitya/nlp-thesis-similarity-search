  "abstract": "In this thesis, I want to analyze two Disney princess films entitled Moana and Brave. This thesis discusses the changes in the character of Disney princesses who are usually seen by many people as just sitting around and waiting for others to help them. That is the reason why I want to focus on the main characters named Moana and Merida who have another side of a princess. This thesis talks about the problem of how the characters of Moana and Merida reflect the characteristics of women's strengths. This thesis aims to show that Moana and Merida can reflect the characteristics of women's strengths through their decisiveness smartness, and boldness. In this study, I use Girl power theory. As a result, I found Moana and Merida reflecting the characteristics of Girl power which made them show a new side of the characteristics of a princess that is usually displayed by Disney.",
