  "title": "The Cohesive ties of Joseph Kahn's news in The New York Times",
  "abstract": "In this study, the writer investigated the cohesive ties that occurred in Joseph Kahn?s news in The New York Times in terms of grammatical and lexical cohesion, and the frequency of occurrence of each cohesive tie. The theory of cohesion by Halliday and Hasan (1976) was used as the main theory in this research. In her study, the writer used the descriptive-qualitative approach. She analyzed three news reports written by Kahn in October 2007 which were retrieved from The New York Times? website (nytimes.com). Cohesive tie that was used the most by Kahn was reiteration (71.08%). Reiteration was followed by reference, collocation, conjunction, and ellipsis whose frequencies of occurrences were 16.88%, 8.02%, 2.67%, and 1.22%. Then, cohesive tie that occurred the least was substitution. It only occurred for 0.12%. The subdivision of the cohesive ties that occurred the most was same item repetition with the frequency 61.60%. The use of cohesive ties by Kahn can be the indicator that he wanted to avoid ambiguity so that the readers could understand his news easily.",
