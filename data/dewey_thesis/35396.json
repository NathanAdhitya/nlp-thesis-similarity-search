  "title": "A Company profile: a way to promote the new English for business communication program of Petra Christian University",
  "abstract": "English for Business Communication (EBC) is a new program of the English Department, Petra Christian University. As a new program, EBC needs to attract many potential customers, like high school students and their parents in order for this program to grow and develop. However, few people know EBC, and some of them even misunderstand EBC’s study focus. Thus, EBC needs a tool, which functions as not only a resume, but also a marketing tool for EBC, to introduce and clarify its unique strengths as a new program. Therefore, I decide to create its new company profile booklet. The company profile booklet contains EBC history (“EBC-ED”), general overview (“What is EBC?”), product and service description, successes and milestones (“Why EBC?”), alumni and student testimonials (“What Do Our Alumni and Students Say?), and contact information (“How to Reach Us?”). Through this information, EBC can use the company profile to credibly introduce and promote itself as a new unique program. Hopefully, the company profile can clarify the customers’ misunderstandings regarding its study focus. Finally, EBC can use the company profile to attract more potential customers, high school students to join EBC and students’ parents to enroll their children in EBC, so that EBC can grow and develop.",
