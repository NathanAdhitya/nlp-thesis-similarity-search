  "abstract": "This thesis is a case study which uses sociolinguistic approach in analyzing Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering's character in B.Shaw's Pygmalion. This study is trying to prove that Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering have contrast manner and characters although they have the same educational and social background. Hence, the analysis and interpretation of the characters are based on the use of the language which is limited on the employment of taboo word, command, term of address, metaphor and sarcasm. The data for the analysis are obtained from Professor Higgins's and Colonel Pickering speeches uttered to all characters in the play from Act I to Act V. The data covers language factors and social factors which are analyzed later to get the conclusion of the language use. From the conclusion of the language use, the interpretation of Professor Higgins's and Colonel Picttering's character is drawn. At the final conclusion, the study shows that Professor Higgins have contrast characters with Colonel Pickering. While Higgins is a discriminative, arrogant and impolite man, Pickering is an undiscriminative, gentle, and polite man. Higgins is impatient and bad tempered compared to Pickering who is patient and appreciative.",
