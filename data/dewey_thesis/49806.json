  "title": "Unwritten scars: gaslighting in relationships",
  "abstract": "Gaslighting is a modern term that describes a type of toxic relationship that psychologically abuses the victim. Gaslighting is understood as manipulating the victim into questioning his sanity and the gaslighter has a goal to create a ‘surreal’ environment that will cause the victim to feel like he is in the wrong and is crazy. Since gaslighting is all about manipulation, it can cause mental disorders such as anxiety, depression and low self-esteem. To spread awareness regarding this topic, I will deliver it in a series of poems. This series of poems have the goals of telling the story about what gaslighting is, how it affects the victim and how the victim can learn to self-heal from the painful experience. This creative work will be using the theory of Gaslighting and Self-Actualization. In creating this thesis, more people can learn about gaslighting, how to deal with it and hopefully start their journey of self-healing through my work.",
