  "title": "When to stop testing: a proposal for using logistic and bass models to determine stopping criteria for software testing at PT AGIT",
  "abstract": "The growth of the information technology industry seems to have progressed rapidly instead of slowing down over the last decade. An abundantly variety of software are constantly developed through thorough development processes, which included an essential part known as software testing. Software testing itself can come in different forms and methods according to the developers and engineers who creates them; each company have a different approach. Software testing essentially identify defects and bugs within the software system, which is then fixed and developed for the better. In almost all cases, it is nearly impossible to know the total number of defects within the system. If the company awaits perfection, then there is an unknown amount of time before the software product is set to release. This inspired for the question: when should the software be released? This research is an attempt to answer the said question, and to support developers alike in their decision-making process of when to release their software products. Such approach is intuitive, with supporting quantitative analysis used.",
