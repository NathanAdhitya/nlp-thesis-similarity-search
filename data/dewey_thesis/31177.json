  "abstract": "This research is aiming to analyze the character traits of the male and female characters inside the comics that called Crayon Shinchan. The character traits in Shinchan seem to be contrary to the structure of masculine and feminine traits, thus I decided to discuss feminine and masculine character traits that are adopted by the characters. I am interested in discussing the feminine character traits that are adopted by the male characters and the masculine character traits that are adopted by the female characters by analyzing the feminine character traits that are adopted by the male characters and the masculine character traits that are adopted by the female characters in a patriarchal society in Japan. I am using patriarchal system theory in analyzing this thesis. Under the patriarchal system, there are rigid segregation of gender roles and the expected feminine and masculine traits. In the discussion I am using, some characters who are husband, wife, the principal and teachers to be analyzed. The main purpose of doing this thesis is that even though some of the male characters are adopting the feminine character traits and the female characters are adopting the masculine character traits, the gender roles in patriarchal system remain unchanged.",
