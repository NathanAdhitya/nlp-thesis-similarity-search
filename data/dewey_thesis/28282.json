  "title": "Tina Kennards identity formation in Ilene Chaikens The L Word",
  "abstract": "Tina Kennard is one of the main lesbian characters in The L Word who keeps shifting her sexual preferences throughout the series. The reasons behind her shifting will be the statement of the problem of this thesis. To answer this study, I use the concept of identity, particularly by Stuart Hall. This theory is appropriate to observe how Tina's identity is formed through her sexual preferences because it suggests the idea that the process of searching for identity is continuous. In this study, I find out that the shifting is a response towards the identity confusion inside Tina; she does not know what she wants, so she is easily influenced by the people who are close to her, such as, her family members; particularly her older sister and her father. It is also her partners; Bette and Helena –her homosexual partners, and Henry –her heterosexual partner. In addition to the people who influence her is her community; the heterosexual and the homosexual friends. From the analysis, it can be concluded that it is possible for people to undergo identity change and that identity is a never-ending process.",
