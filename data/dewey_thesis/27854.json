  "abstract": "This thesis examines the individuation of two main characters in Harry Potter series which are Potter and Voldemort. To live completely as a whole, an individual need to be individuated. One can be individuated person when he can manage his own archetypes. Archetypes are the model or pattern that can be seen in every individual. Potter and Voldemort who are very different individuals in Harry Potter Series act as models to be analyzed in how they can find their individuation through their management of their own archetypes. To be individuated, Potter and Voldemort must know and manage their three main archetypes which are persona or his mask, including his appearance, behavior and role in the society. Potter and Voldemort must confront their inner dark sides or shadows. Also, they must balance his anima which is the feminine traits of man, comes from internal or external. By managing those three archetypes, Potter can be an individuated person who can lead a good life. However, Voldemort who fails in knowing his persona, being dominated by his own shadow and cannot balance his anima can be non-individuated person and as a climactic effect he will be dead before becoming as a whole.",
