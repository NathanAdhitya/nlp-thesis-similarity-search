  "abstract": "This Thesis is a study of Sheridan's masterpiece, The School for Scandal. In this study, I highlight the idea of a man of sentiment in the eighteenth century as revealed through the main male characters, Charles and Joseph, as the major problem of the analysis. In this study, I want to reveal the qualities of a man of sentiment by analyzing Charles' and Joseph's character traits. I use the theory of characterization to analyze Charles' and Joseph's character traits to discuss which one of them is a man of sentiment. Aside from that, I also use the definition of sentiment to know the meaning of the man of sentiment. Charles who is famous as an extravagant and a libertine finally is considered as a man of sentiment. Charles has good deeds. In his action, he is honest, loyal, benevolent and honorable. On the contrary, Joseph who always speaks based on sentiment, is considered as a hypocrite because he just shows sentiments in his speech, but not in his action. He is a rake, unsympathetic to someone' help, and a bad brother. Therefore, Charles is finally considered as the real man of sentiment, while Joseph is considered as a hypocrite. I find out that the quality of the man of sentiment is more determined by someone's actions rather than someone's speech.",
