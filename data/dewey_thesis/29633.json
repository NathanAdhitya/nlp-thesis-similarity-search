  "title": "A Video guideline on giving information: a solution for the receptionists lack of English communication skills at the Alana Hotel Surabaya",
  "abstract": "Based on my internship experience at a serviced apartment in Surabaya, I found that the receptionists, who were mostly vocational high schools graduates, had difficulty in giving information to foreign guests in English appropriately. As a result, this problem led to customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, I thought a video guideline which contains the steps and procedures to give information to the guests in English will be the best solution for the problem. The video guideline which contains the steps and procedures for giving information about check ins, hotel facilities, and check outs will help the receptionist to handle foreign guests who want to do check in, ask about hotel facilities, and do check out in English appropriately. Besides that, this video guideline can also help hotels to maintain their customers by giving satisfactory services to the guests. Moreover, there are some steps to get to the video guideline: determining the topic for the video guideline, creating the role play situations, writing the scripts, doing the rehearsals, and performing the role plays.",
