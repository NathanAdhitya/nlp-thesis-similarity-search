  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of the choice of codes used by the announcers of DJ FM and SS FM radios in their advertisements, consisting of twenty advertisements from both radios. The purposes are to know the choice of codes used by both radios in their advertisements considering the target audience. I applied some theories of codes from Wardaugh (2006), Stockwell (2002), and Holmes (2001) as my main theories. Also, I used the theory of Age and Linguistic choice from Coulmas (2005), Marketing and Language Choice from Victor (2007), and Addressee as an Influence on Style from Holmes (2001) as my supporting theories. The subjects are two announcers of DJ FM and SS FM radios which are in the phase of young adulthood. Furthermore, after I got the data and analyzed the data, I found that the announcers from both radio stations used Standard Indonesia as their main code. Besides Standard Indonesian, they also used Non-Standard Indonesian and English. However, there were two languages namely Javanese language and Arabic language that appeared in the advertisements of DJ FM. The conclusion is the target audience of DJ FM and SS FM did not influence the way the announcers chose their codes.",
