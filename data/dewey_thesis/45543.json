The redesign itself focused on improving the visual of the digital map and the process of making it. Thus, the main question of this academic research is \"How to improve digital maps within the WOOV app to have better user experience while also making the working process more efficient?\". First, in order to implement change to the digital map, a desk research and literature study is done to learn what possibility can be used from Mapbox Mapping Platform to improve WOOV digital maps. Moreover, to create guidelines for the design improvements, a literature study is carried out from Buckley's and Walton's article of Map Design Principles and Slaughter's studies on designing digital maps for mobile devices. Another desk research on how the company handle the process of making the digital map is done to get better understanding of what can be fixed or improved.
