  "abstract": "Their Eyes Were Watching God is a novel by Zora Neale Hurston that tells about the journey of an African-American woman into womanhood and accomplishment of love. The main character of the novel, Janie Mae Crawford experiences character development from the process of findings her true love through the four persons in her life. Thus, I am curious to know how Janie finds her true love through the four important persons in her life. Through the analysis, I want to reveal Janie?s former characters as a young girl and the ways Janie finds her true love through the four important persons in her life. In the analysis, I use literary approach and employ literary tools of characterization and conflicts. As a result, I find that Janie?s search of true love has made a great ending to her love life. Moreover, Janie learns to open up herself and be courageous while searching for her true love. She also becomes a mature woman with intelligence and independence. In addition, Janie learns to love and appreciate herself as a whole person. I conclude that Janie?s character traits develop because she has found her true love. Love heals. Therefore, I am sure that building positive love relationship can make everybody change into a better person.",
