  "title": "Marine works with cost estimation for Ashkelon desalination project",
  "abstract": "Israel has an extremely tight water supply and most of the reservoir at that country are drying up. Because of the increasing demand of the freshwater in the future, it is necessary to make some reservoir or water supplies from the neighbour coimtry. But, political difficulties with some of Israel's neighbours make water supplies from nearby countries problematic even supposing th at those countries have sufficient fresh water to be able to oblige. Israelâ€™s chronic shortage of water has led Mekorot, the state owned Israeli water company, to look at desalination as a solution. Mekorot is therefore seeking to build desalination plants at Haifa, Tel. Aviv, and Zikim (Ashkelon). The plants would involve extremely advanced reverse osmosis technology which would use pure seawater as well as brackish water. Because of those reason, there will be a Ashkelon Desalination Project. Since the project covers very wide aspects, the study will be only on the marine works and cost estimation. The study will be done by studying preliminary design, analyse the structure, analyse contract and tendering, make cost estimation for the project, and studying th e construction method (execution works). In the end, th e result of the study will give the right cost estimation and risk analysis of the project and the best construction method that can be applied in this project.",
