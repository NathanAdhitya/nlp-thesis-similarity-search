  "abstract": "This research aims to help people understand about turn-taking irregularities, overlap and interruption and why it occurs. The classification of interruption is based on the definition of the interruption from Wardhaugh (1985). The writer believes that interruption and overlap are caused by certain reasons. The writer is interested in observing interruption and overlap in “Indonesia Lawyers Club” because she wanted to know which parties in this show produced more number of interruptions and overlaps, especially in an interactive dialog. There are two parties in this dialog, namely host and guests/panelist. This study was a qualitative study; the writer got the data from the transcript, which she did it manually. The writer analyzed all interruptions and overlaps from the host an guests/panelists which occurred in this show and classified the reason. The writer wanted to find out what the common reason of interruption and overlap are in this study.
