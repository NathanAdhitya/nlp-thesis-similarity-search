  "title": "Reasons and effects of Rosalind?s disguise as a man as seen in Shakespeare?s As You Like It",
  "abstract": "An extremely fascinating idea, which is boldly exposed in one of the brilliant Shakespeare?s comedies, As You Like It, is the exceptional domination of the main female character, Rosalind, who chooses to disguise herself as a man in the society of Elizabethan era. This out of ordinary idea triggers some questions about the reasons and effects of her choice. In performing this study, the thesis writer uses literary approach which is focusing on characterization and conflict as the main tools. She also uses gender concept to support her analysis. Gender concept is important to be applied in order to maintain the difference between man and woman in the society, especially about the ideal woman in the Elizabethan society. In the analysis, the thesis writer finds that the reasons of Rosalind?s choice to disguise as a man are her safety and her mission with her love. Furthermore, the effects of Rosalind?s disguise herself as a man are the conflicts with herself and the conflict with Phebe.",
