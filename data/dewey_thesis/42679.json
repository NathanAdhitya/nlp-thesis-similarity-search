  "title": "Behind the mask and look me in the eye: exploring the relation of self- confidence with conformity in today's teenagers",
  "abstract": "Teenagers are particularly susceptible to conformity and apparently self-confidence plays a significant role in how teenagers make individual choices. Drawing on the relevance between the two, this creative project explores today’s teenagers manner on conformity and assesses how teenagers self-confidence is related to their decision to conform or not to conform. To understand how self-confidence and conformity relate to each other deeper, I use the three processes of attitude change and self-confidence as my theory. This creative project is two plays of 30 minute play which talk about the same thing but will be seen from different perspective. Behind the Mask focuses on how a teenager who has lack of self-confidence conforms to her peer group while Look Me in the Eye focuses on how a teenager who has self-confidence conforms to her peer group. Showing different perspective help me conveying my purpose of writing the plays which is to help teenagers understand that conformity in daily life is inevitable and how their self-confidence plays an important role so that they will not get influenced by conformity easily. For the genre, the plays use realistic drama as the genre conventions suit the style of my plays which portrays a conflict that happens in teenagers’ daily life in a realistic way.",
