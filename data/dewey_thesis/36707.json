  "title": "The Communicative criteria found in 10th year of public senior High School English coursebooks",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a materials evaluation using communicative criteria. This topic is chosen considering coursebooks are important teaching tools and communication ability is now a standard in pedagogical field. It aims to find the communicative criteria applied in the coursebooks. The writer attempts to find the criteria application and finds that the materials in the coursebooks apply to some extent the communicative criteria concerning the language knowledge, interaction, and language practice and use. The materials in the coursebooks are analyzed with constructed communicative criteria from Communicative Language Teaching principles by Larsen-Freeman and Anderson (2011). This study method is qualitative. The data are from 10th Year Senior High School English coursebooks for public schools in Indonesia. In conclusion, the coursebooks are fairly communicative because most materials apply one or more communicative criteria, except for most materials in Vocabulary and Pronunciation sections. Further studies can be conducted on the materials suitability with studentsâ€™ needs, the language skills and components and communicative competence taught.",
