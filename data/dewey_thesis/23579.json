  "title": "The Character study of Nostromo through plot and setting in Joseph Conrad's Nostromo",
  "abstract": "Nostromo who is used by Conrad as the title of the novel is considered by him not as the novel?s hero. However, from the analysis of Nostromo through plot and setting the writer of this thesis proves that Nostromo is the protagonist in the novel. The plot shows that he becomes the central character fro the beginning until the end of the plot. What is revealed in the plot is his life and the change of his life from a good man into a thief. Moreover, the settings time, place, and environment also show that Nostromo is the most important character in the novel. The time and place describe the actions of Nostromo, while the environment influences Nostromo?s life. Nostromo is the only character that is described and influenced by the setting. This fact shows that he is the protagonist. Thus, from the plot and setting we can see that Nostromo always becomes the cetral character and it proves that he plays a very important role and certainly is the protagonist in the novel.",
