  "title": "The Effect of production factors toward pellet durability index in PTJapfa Comfeed Indonesia Sidoarjo",
  "abstract": "Pelleting is considered one of the crucial production processes in feed manufacturing industry, in which has most energy allocation among others. One of the quality measurement in feed manufacturing is Pellet Durability Index (PDI). This research has an objective to analyze the effect of several production factors toward PDI in PT Japfa Comfeed Indonesia, Sidoarjo. Production factors that become the interests for this research are nutritional content, conditioning temperature, cooler temperature, particle size, die speed, die thickness, and die retention time. Those production factors are determined based on the feed manufacturing theories and operational field condition in PT Japfa Comfeed Indonesia. The data sample is taken from company documentation using cluster sampling. For the analytical method, this research will uses multiple regression analysis, in which can formulate the effect of all factors toward PDI simultaneously.
