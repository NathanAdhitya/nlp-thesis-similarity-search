  "title": "The impact of the elements of eWOM in influencing Android smartphone purchase intention in Indonesia",
  "abstract": "The influence of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on consumer's purchase intention has long been known. The eWOM has brought great impact in smartphone purchase intention in worldwide scale. However, the fast improvements and penetrations of information technology in Indonesia have changed the behavior of internet users, especially in young generations. Therefore, the research aims to analyze the existing worldwide phenomenon to be implemented in Indonesia, whose penetration of information technology has been so fast lately. There were 1472 valid respondents used in this research by using simple random sampling. The results suggest that the elements of eWOM are simultaneously influencing the purchase intention of Android smartphone. However, there are two independent variables, which are not significant in the model. The most significant element of eWOM in influencing the purchase intention in Indonesia is the receiver's expertise.",
