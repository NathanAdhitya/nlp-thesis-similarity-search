  "abstract": "African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is the variety of non-standard English which is often used by black American people. It is also used in many American films, songs, and so on. The writer wants to know the use of AAVE and SE in the future father in-law and son in-law relationship in \"Guess Who\" since the main characters, Percy and Simon, have different ethnicity; those are black and white. In analyzing the data, the writer uses Trudgill?s (1983) AAVE linguistics items, Labov?s (1972) AAVE features and Quirk?s (1985) SE. Also, the writer uses the theory of social factors and social dimension by Holmes (1992). The writer makes some tables to analyze the use of Percy?s and Simon?s AAVE and SE. The result shows that there is a shift in Percy?s and Simon?s codes where Percy, who often uses AAVE at the beginning of the film, has changed his code by using more SE while talking to Simon in the end of the film. On the other hand, Simon, who always uses SE at the beginning of the film, has raised his AAVE in the end of the film while talking to Percy. Thus, Percy?s and Simon?s codes can shift because both of them have tolerance and willingness in their relationship.",
