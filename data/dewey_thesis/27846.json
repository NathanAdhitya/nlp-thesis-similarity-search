  "abstract": "This study discusses the Black Power’s ideas inside the three poems of Maya Angelou, “Still I Rise”, “Phenomenal Woman”, and “Weekend Glory”. Maya Angelou is one of the most important African-American authors and orators of the twentieth century. She was highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. From Angelou’s poems, I can understand the struggle of the author as a powerless Black African-American woman. The purpose of this study is to find out in what ways Black power is revealed in Maya Angelou’s three poems. Moreover, Black power movement concept and figurative language are needed to reveal the idea of Black power in each poem. The analysis shows that there are differences of ideas of Black power in each poem. First, the Black power idea is the way to survive in the society. Second Black Power is the way to express someone’s thought. Third idea is the ability to accept her identity as a Black woman. In the end, it can be concluded that the author is no longer a powerless Black woman, but she has the power to change her life.",
