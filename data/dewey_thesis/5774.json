  "title": "The Request strategies used by the male superior and the female subordinate before and after having close relationship in the film Two Weeks Notice",
  "abstract": "In this research, the writer is interested in investigating request strategies since males and females can use them differently, especially when they deal with different social status and solidarity. Here, the writer wants to know about request strategies used by main male superior and female subordinate character in the film Two Weeks Notice. The writer uses Ervin-Trip?s theory to categorize the types of request; she also uses descriptive quantitative approach in describing the possible factors in the regularity of the type of request used by the main characters before and after they know each other well. The results show that the main male superior character (Mr. Wade) frequently uses question directives, while the main female subordinate character (Lucy) mostly uses question directives as well as hint directives, before they have close relationship. Then, after the solidarity exists, the writer finds that both characters regularly use bald imperatives. It means that both of them use indirect request strategies before having close relationship, and shift into direct request strategies after having close relationship.",
