Besides,the thesis writer also finds out war causes the soldiers have to separate from the people that they love very much.Through Last Poems,the thesis writer also proves that suffering and death are tragedy of life.The soldiers have been through difficult time during the war.They have an opportunity to be killed or wounded.The wounded body shows the suffering of the speakers before they face their death. Death is the tragedy of life since their death is equated as the death of animals.It shows that their lives are unworthy.",
