  "abstract": "This study discusses the use of translation strategies in translating Indonesian culture-bound words in two Indonesia tourism website articles. By using a descriptive qualitative analysis method, the translation strategies found in the Indonesian culture-bound words were observed using the theory from Mona Baker (2018). The rank of the most dominant strategies, from the most frequent to the least, used by both translator teams of Wonderful Indonesia and Enjoy Jakarta are loan word with an explanation, word-for-word, cultural substitution, and general word. In the Indonesia culture-bound translation, the most used strategy in the translation of the culture-bound words is loan word strategy. It is better because to maintain the original meaning of these cultural words the translation team prefers to borrow words from the original language and explain these words by including an the background explanation of the words or recipes of the words, so that foreign tourists can find out the meaning behind the words that are bound to Indonesian culture without changing the original word. In conclusion, both translator teams mostly used loan word strategy as their main strategy in the English translation, but still used other strategy in certain Indonesia culture-bound words.",
