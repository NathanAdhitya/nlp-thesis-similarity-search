  "abstract": "This is a study on the Inflectional Suffix Errors in Subject ? Predicate Agreement Produced by English Department Students in Writing 2. The writer wants to find out whether or not the students of English Department in Petra Christian University especially in Writing 2 class still produce errors when they express their ideas in writing essay. In this thesis, the writer analyzes the errors based on the theory of Stageberg and Oaks (2000) combined with Ho?s theory (2005) and the writer groups the errors into four types of verb inflectional suffix, such as present third-person singular, present participle, past tense, and past participle. After analyzing the data, the writer also provides the correct form of the errors. From the analysis, the writer finds that the students of Writing 2 make errors in present third-person singular form, present participle form, past tense form, and past participle form. The most errors that they make is the present third-person singular form because of misformation. This condition reveals that they still have difficulties in differentiating the subject whether it is singular or plural noun. The writer hopes that this thesis can be beneficial for the students who want to conduct similar research.",
