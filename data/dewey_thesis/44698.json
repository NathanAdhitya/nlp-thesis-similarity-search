  "title": "Masculinity in selected L-Men advertisements",
  "abstract": "This thesis analyzes how L-Men persuades its target market to buy its product through its advertisements’ verbal and non-verbal expressions. The verbal and non-verbal expressions of L-Men advertisements which I analyze are taken from two video advertisements that are entitled “L-Men 2018: 2Go & Gain Mass: Men’s Guide” and “Iklan L-Men Gain Mass Terbaru 2014 Versi Albert Sultan”. In the analysis, I try to find out how masculinity is projected in the advertisements chosen. In so doing, I conduct the analysis with the help of Multimodal Discourse Analysis theory. As this thesis is multimodal research, I use the qualitative approach for my analysis as it allows me to interpret the findings of my data. From my analysis, I found out that L-Men advertisements verbal and non-verbal expressions are projecting masculinity. The masculinity, however, is different for the two advertisements. The 2018 advertisement shows that masculinity is based on stylish appearance, while the 2014 advertisement shows that masculinity is based on the muscular body. Thus, it can be concluded that L-Men is trying to tell its target market that using L-Men will make them be seen as masculine in multiple ways.",
