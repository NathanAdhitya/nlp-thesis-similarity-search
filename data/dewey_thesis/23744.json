  "abstract": "This study observed the function of hedges in the utterances containing hedges used by Jackson Rod Stewart and Miley Stewart or Hannah Montana as male and female characters in the third season of \"Hannah Montana\" television series. This study attempted to find out the functions of hedges used by male and female characters and also the comparison between both of them in terms of functions of hedges. The main theory of this study was Coates?s theory of function of hedges (1996). As its approach, the writer used qualitative approach supported by quantitative data. The findings of this analysis showed that the most frequently used function of hedges produced by the male character was \"expression of confidence\". Meanwhile, hedges functioning as \"sensitivity to other?s feeling\" was the most frequently used function of hedges produced by the female character. However, both of them had a similarity in the cases of the least frequently used function of hedges. \"Avoiding playing expert\" was the function of hedges that they rarely used in this series.",
