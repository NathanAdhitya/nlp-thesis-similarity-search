  "title": "A Study of Arthur Miller's figure of speech in all my sons and death of a salesman",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of figures of speech in two plays of Arthur Miller entitled All My Sons and Death of A Salesman.The writer observes three main purposes:To find out the most frequently used figure of speech,its application in every act,and the functions of the use of figure of speech to reveal the main characters' emotions. To reach the purposes,the supporting theories such as linguistics,sociolinguistics,stylistics, figure of speech,and ethnography are needed to be the foundation for the writer to identify the data. The data covers language factors and social factors.For language factor,the writer collects all the utterances containing figure of speech which are identified by viewing from the form,the meaning,and the mixture of the form and the meaning of the utterances. By analyzing the quantitative data,the writer tries to infer qualitative interpretation as the conclusion of the study.",
