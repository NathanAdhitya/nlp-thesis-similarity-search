  "title": "Nature in William Wordsworth's poems",
  "abstract": "\"Nature in William Wordsworth's poems\" is focussed on some of Wordsworth's poems which describe the relationships between nature and Wordsworth's personal life, nature and human life,also nature as God's creation. This thesis also shows Wordsworth's attitudes toward nature. He appreciates and adores the beauty of nature as something which cannot be separated from his life. He believes that nature is the guide of his life. This analysis deals with seven poems of Wordsworth. All of the seven poems here represent the relationships between man , nature, and God. Shortly, those poems represent the description of nature ,of man as an individual being, of man in the relationship with the beauty of nature and also of man in the relationship with the existence of God. Hopefully, the writer's analysis could be helpful and beneficial to the readers who are willing to appreciate nature in Wordsworth's poems.",
