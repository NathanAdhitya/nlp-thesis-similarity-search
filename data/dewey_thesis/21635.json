  "title": "A Significant episodic pattern as the manifestation of moll's ambition for economic security in Defoe's Moll Flanders",
  "abstract": "Defoe?s Moll Flanders vividly picturizes the human struggle for survival in the eighteenth-century London society. Moll is visualized as courageously faces the risks of shifting for herself in a society hostile to her aim of becoming a woman with economic security. In relevance to this, the writer of the thesis wants to reveal that Moll's struggle to reach her desire is manifested into a significant episodic, pattern. Moll acts principally as a sole actor who strives to attain her obsession for economic security. In context with the eight eenth-century London society, economic security refers to the posession of the middle class status, as well as wealth. In the first episode of the episodic pattern, Moll displays her effort in trading on her sex as the prime commodity to reach her obsession, while on the second episode, Moll turns to crime, as a short cut to attain her dream. Through the description of the significant pattern, it can be seen that Moll's anticipations towards the existing social condition displays the definite attempt to follow the trend of the society. The desire to establish her identity never ceases, and with the economic motive, Moll strives to gain her desire for a more comfortable and respectable life.",
