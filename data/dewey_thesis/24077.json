  "abstract": "George Webber is a writer who lives in the modern life. As an adult, he has to stay in an individualist social environment. In short, George Webber's perception about Libya Hill people changes. Then, the interest-ing part of this study is the conflict between George Webber-s principles against Libya Hill people's principles of life. The writer wants to explain why George Webber cannot go home again and whst causes the change of both Libya Hill people and George Webber. Having to handle Libya Hill's situation, George Webber writes a novel about whatever Libya Hill people have done. He wants Libya Hill people to realize their mistakes, and accept George's principles to be their principles of life. However, George Webber does not succeed in his work. He is not being hailed as the poet and the genius of the mountain country but he is considered as a traitor by Libya Hill people. He cannot influence Libya Hill people as social environment and desire can influence them. George Webber-s weak characters destroy himself. His being narrow-minded and rash make him not able to go home again. Besides, Libya Hill people do not want to change their principles as long as their society oes not change.",
