  "abstract": "At production process, steel of AISI 01 need to be heat treatment for hardening with quenching. This will produce high residual stress after hardening. They have high risks about quench cracks and distortion. Marquenching or martempering process tried to solve that problems. In the experiments has three kind of test. There are hardness test, impact test and metallografi.....From experiments results have a conclution. They have that the marquenching process had high toughness and fine micro structure of martensite than quenching.",
