  "title": "When the flower wilts: stigmas of mental illness in Indonesia",
  "abstract": "In this study, I would like to create a novel portraying the stigmas of mental illnesses, specifically depression, in Indonesia. The purpose of the creative work was to demonstrate how a depression sufferer affects their immediate family in terms of economy, psychology, and social life, and the life situation resulting from such a burden. The theoretical frameworks I used include researches involving costs, the views of society towards a sufferer, and how the family is affected, primarily the burden of sympathy from such an ordeal. I used primarily secondary data from researches and journals, and primary data to create minor worldbuilding details within the creative work. The researches done to complete the creative work reveals how taking care of a sufferer places a heavy burden on the immediate family in terms of social life, economy, and psychology.",
