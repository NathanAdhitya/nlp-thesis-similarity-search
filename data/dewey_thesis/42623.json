  "title": "The perception of Petra Christian University students towards the connection between “Converse” brand and its “Proud to be” statement on its t-shirt line",
  "abstract": "This thesis mainly deals with the theory of perception and decoding process to observe how Petra Christian University students perceive Converse brand and the use of language in one of its T-shirt products, “Proud to be”. The focus of the researcher’s analysis is the perception towards the connection between Converse brand and the use of language in its product design, in this case “Proud to be” statement within its context, the rainbow color. Schiffman and Kanuk’s theory of perception helps the researcher to analyze the data as underlying theory as well as Chandler’s decoding theory in semiotic. Those two theories are used to analyze the connection between how the students see Converse’s brand personality and the message they perceive from “Proud to be” T-shirt. The researcher analyzes the data qualitatively for this deals with people’s opinion. From the analysis, the researcher found out that the students could draw a line between the brand and its statement on its T-shirt design. This means that “Proud to be” statement is considered a success as a code to express the company’s message to its consumers and suits the brand personality of Converse. In conclusion, the language used in product design is able to communicate the brand personality.",
