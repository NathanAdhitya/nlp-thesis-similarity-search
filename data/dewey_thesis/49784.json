  "title": "Derik the Dutch and the Klapertaart and other stories: children's picture book exploring racist bullying among children",
  "abstract": "This thesis discusses racist bullying in children which refers to the hurtful actions or comments toward people of different races among children. Using childrenâ€™s picture books with low fantasy as the genre, this creative thesis shows how racist bullies learn of prejudices toward certain races which cause them to bully others of different races, and how the victims can cope with the stress of being racially bullied. With emphasis given to the victims more than the bullies, three stories implement Transactional Theory of Stress and Coping to show how children can cope with the stress of being racially bullied. Maruna, Anita, and Derik, the main characters, use problem focused coping, especially planful problem solving to stop the racist bullies from bullying them. The other two stories use Developmental Intergroup Theory to show how children learn prejudices toward other races by learning from the adults around them. The main characters, Winda and Da Ji, are influenced by the adults around them in developing prejudices against others from different races and then bullying them.",
