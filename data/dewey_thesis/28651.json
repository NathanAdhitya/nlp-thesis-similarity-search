  "title": "The Speech styles of pastor in a public and a youth service",
  "abstract": "This is a sociolinguistic study that focuses on the speech styles used by a Pastor in delivering the sermon in a Public Service and a Youth Service. Firstly, the writer wants to find out the types of speech styles used by a Pastor to address the Public Service congregation which consists of older adults and the Youth Service congregation which consists of young adults. The next, the writer wants to find out the differences and/or similarities of the speech styles used by the Pastor in both kinds of services. In order to know the characteristics of speech styles used by the Pastor, this writer chooses the main theory of formal and informal Bahasa Indonesia as proposed by Tampubolon (1978) which are supported by the theory of lexical and grammatical characteristics for standard Bahasa Indonesia by Kridalaksana (1989). As results, this research shows that the Pastor mostly used informal style in both services. This happened because the Pastor wanted to more get closer with the Public and Youth Service congregation. The next, it was shown that the Pastor tended to use more formal style to the Public Service congregation than to the Youth Service congregation. This happened because the Pastor knew exactly that the Youth Service was supposed to be given more attention and clearer explanation about the message given.",
