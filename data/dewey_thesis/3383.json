  "title": "A Stylistic approach to Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone by J.K. Rowling",
  "abstract": "Some people enjoy reading a piece of a literary work (a novel, poetry, etc.) without realizing that every piece of literary work has its own characteristics and unique styles that also represent the characteristics and the styles of the writer. Due to the reason, the writer of this thesis conducts a study about figures of speech which are used in a writing, especially a novel titles Harry Potter and the Philosopher?s Stone because the writer realizes that the figures of speech have become the tool to create the beauty and unique style of the novel by J. K. Rowling as the writer. In fact, the figures of speech could determine whether a literature really has a literary value or not. Through this study, the writer of this thesis is curious about what figures of speech are being used in the novel to create the literary value. This study is being conducted by using stylistics theory as the main theory because it can be used to discover the style of a literary work through linguistic point of view. However, the study also uses other supporting theories that have connection with this study, such as theory of semantics, diction, pragmatics, and discourse analysis. Moreover, the qualitative approach is being used because the data consists of words instead of numbers.",
