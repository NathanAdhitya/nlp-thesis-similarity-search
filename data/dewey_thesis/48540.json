  "title": "Women with power to construct and exercise strategies as portrayed in 7 Wonders",
  "abstract": "As a modernized version of the folktale Jaka Tarub dan Tujuh Bidadari, 7 Wonders describes the female characters as weak people who should please the male characters. However, I find that in the story, the female characters’ actions justify that they are influential people who can use anything as their strategies to reach their goals. Thus, this study aims to discuss that the female characters construct three plans, altering their looks, using their support as a means of negotiation, and acting as weak women. In the analysis, I use two theories, which are the Javanese concepts of ideal women and girl power, that help me see how the female characters construct and exercise their strategies. As a result, the female characters can persuade the male characters to help them reach their goals, proving that the female characters’ plans can be used to control the male characters.",
