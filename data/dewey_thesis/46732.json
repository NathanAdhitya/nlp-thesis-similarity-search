  "title": "Optimus prime’s being more human than Megatron in Alan Dean Foster’s Transformers",
  "abstract": "This is a study about ARO (Autonomous Robotic Organisms) namely Optimus Prime’s being more human than Megatron, in Alan Dean Foster’s Transformers. In this thesis, I will reveal the causes and the ways why Optimus Prime is more rational than Megatron. I will use the literary approach using characterization and conflict. Both the theory of conflict and characterization will be used to analyze Optimus Prime to reveal the causes and the ways of Optimus Prime to be more human than Megatron. In analyzing this novel, I will explain the origins of Optimus Prime’s being more social than Megatron. They are his love of peace, Earthmen, and Earth, his forgiving heart, his polite speech, and his objections to Megatron’s greediness and hurting. Meanwhile, in discussions of the ways, I discover the actions that Optimus Prime does. The steps that Optimus Prime takes are treating human nicely, making ally, restricting Megatron’s and Decepticons’ plans, getting the Earthmen involved in reaching the Cube and sacrificing himself for the sake of everyone. Optimus Prime is more human than Megatron since he has excellent characteristics, unlike Megatron. There is no doubt that he can show his unique features through his actions. Therefore, from the traits he has and the steps he does, Optimus Prime is more human than Megatron.",
