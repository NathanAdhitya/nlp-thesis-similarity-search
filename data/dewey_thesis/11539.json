  "title": "Peter Wiggin's ambition to create a peaceful future for earth in Orson Scott Card's Shadow of the giant",
  "abstract": "In this analysis of Shadow of the Giant, I am curious to know the reasons of Peter Wiggin?s ambition to create a peaceful future for earth and its effects upon him. I will use the literary theories of characterization and conflict, supported by the psychological theory of personality and motivation to analyze the reasons of Peter Wiggin?s ambition to create a peaceful future for earth and its effects. After reading the novel the writer finds out that Peter Wiggin is ambitious to create a peaceful future for earth by creating a world government, FPE (Free People of Earth). The writer considers that his ambition must have some reasons and effects. The writer finds out that the reasons are his uneasy childhood, his own character, and the chaotic world condition. The writer also finds out that the effects are his personality development, a peaceful future for earth, and his achieving of Wiggin family?s recognition. Through Peter Wiggin, the novel shows that ambition in the company of conscience may bring good things.",
