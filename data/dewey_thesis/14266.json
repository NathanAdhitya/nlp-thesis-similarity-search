Actually, Milly's sacrifice has made Densher change into the awareness of good moral. And, Densher's good character traits also have helped him to overcome his moral evil. This is contrary to Kate Croy who keeps on committing moral evil in her life, supported by her materialistic and egoistic characters. This different view, in fact, has separated them forever. Moral evil, finally, can be found in Kate's and Densher's lives. And, true love which is shown by Milly has defeated Kate's and Densher's moral evil, at last.",
