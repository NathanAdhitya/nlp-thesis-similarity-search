  "title": "A Contextual analysis of the effects of modern technology towards human beings in some of Isaac Asimov science fiction short stories",
  "abstract": "In this thesis,the thesis writer wants to analyze three of Isaac Asimov's science fiction short stories with contextual analysis method.In these three stories;\"All the Troubles of the World\",\"The Feeling of Power\",and \"The Fun They Had\",Asimov wants to convey to the readers the effects of modern technology towards human beings either positive or negative. The three stories indicate the same thing,that is modern technology can influence people's daily lives and they can grow a dependency on it.Although advance technology benefits human lives,the over use of computer brings undesired effects that might endanger human values such as;human is controlled by computer,human's privacy is interferred by computer,technology creates war machine for destroying another human being,human relation becomes weak,child's mental and personal development are influenced by the presence of technology. Actually,modern technology can bring us good and bad effects in the same time so we must eliminate the bad ones and develop the good ones.And the most important is that we must be ready to face every bad effect and prepare earlier and better to deal with them.",
