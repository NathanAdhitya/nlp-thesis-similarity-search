  "title": "Lamenting Stardust: a novel about the struggles of having nightmare disorders",
  "abstract": "Nightmare disorder is an issue that is frequently overlooked, despite the fact that it has serious consequences for those who suffer from it. Because of these factors, the author of this thesis has done additional research on nightmare disorder, its effects, and an innovative way to help solve it through the medium of a novel in order to relay the struggles of those who suffer from nightmare disorder. I used the theories about sleep from Patel, Reddy, and Araujo (2021) and lucid dreaming from Hurd and Bulkeley (2014) to support my findings, research, and novel. Through Sophia's story in the novel, I showed that nightmare disorder can stem from a lot of reasons, including Sophia's personal problems, such as her past trauma and anxiety. I showed how it affected her life in a negative way, to the point that she almost got fired over it, on top of being anxious and tired a lot during the day. Lastly, I showed how lucid dreaming therapy can help alleviate Sophia's nightmare disorder by allowing her to change the contents of her nightmares into something less scary and by empowering her with the knowledge that she can control how her nightmares will go.",
