  "title": "Cognitive semantics of methaphor in infiniti car advertisement texts",
  "abstract": "This thesis mainly deals with the cognitive semantics that can be found in Infiniti car advertisement texts. The focus of the writerâ€™s analysis is the metaphor sentence of the Infiniti car advertisement texts which can be divided into four features of metaphor such as conventionality, systematicity, asymmetry and abstraction features. The writer analyzes the texts of five Infiniti car advertisements that were taken from Travel+Leisure magazine published from January to August 2010. There were five Infiniti car series that she analyzed such as Infiniti G coupe, Infiniti G sedan, Infiniti M, and Infiniti QX series. For the methods, she used a descriptive qualitative approach. Then, from her analysis, she found out that six metaphor sentences of the Infiniti car advertisement texts were categorized as having conventionality, systematicity and abstraction features. The advertiser tries to respond what the customers want from their experiences in driving the car. Thus, s/he delivers message innovatively by experiencing the advantage of Infiniti car with other terms. The advertisers use metaphor to formulate statement which describes the product.",
