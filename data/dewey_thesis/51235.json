  "title": "Masquerade of femininity and masculinity in Japanese comic Midori is a Tomboy and W-Juliet",
  "abstract": "Masquerade is the use of mask and disguise. A person who is masquerading would wear mask to hide a certain identity. By masking, that person also can make a new identity and shows it at the moment he or she is wearing the mask. This study discusses about the use of mask by Makoto and Midori. Makoto is a male character in W-Juliet and Midori is a female character in Midori is a Tomboy. They are wearing the mask because they have a certain purpose which they can get only if they wear the mask. In wearing their mask, Makoto and Midori is doing gender-bending; while Makoto is wearing femininity mask since he is forced to be a girl in achieving his dream, Midori is wearing masculinity mask since she has to disguise herself as a boy in order to carry out her plan. Through Makoto and Midoriâ€™s strategy and meaning in their masquerading, this thesis will show that femininity and masculinity are not related to sex and can be changed based on the needs of the person. Both sexes can utilize femininity or masculinity regardless of their sexes. Also, a person can use femininity and masculinity as mask to hide an identity and create a new identity.",
