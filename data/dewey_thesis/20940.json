  "title": "A Study of power through discourse analysis in Thomas Hardy's the return of the native",
  "abstract": "One's power of personality can be reflected in arguments.In The Return of the Native,the author tells about the conflicting relationship between some of the characters in the novel,namely Mrs.Yeobright and Clym Yeobright,which results in the frequent arguments occuring between them.The writer is,therefore,curious to find out the power of personality as the result of their arguments. As the characters are in the social relation of being the mother and the son,the husband and the wife,the writer is also tempted to discover whether one ?s social role also influences one's power of personality.Due to the fact that one cannot be powerful in all situations,and to support the analysis,the use of context of situation is necessary to see when the person is able to preserve the situations when he gains such power.Having done the analysis,the writer has discovered that it is not true that Mrs.Yeobright as the mother is always able to wield her power to show her power of personality over her son.While in another analysis in , relation with a husband and a wife,it has been revealed that Clym as the husband is more powerful than his wife .",
