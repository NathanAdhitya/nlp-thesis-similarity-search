  "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with a study of the main character's, Colonel Jacque's, misconception of the idea of being a complete gentleman in Daniel Defoe's The History of Colonel Jacque. In this thesis, the thesis writer needs to know the factor that causes Colonel Jacque's misconception of the idea of being a complete gentleman, and his idea about what a gentleman is. To analyze the novel, the thesis writer uses library research, consists of critics' opinions, the idea of being a gentleman and also some data about the novel and the author; and literary approach concerning characterization. In the analysis, the thesis writer assumes that Colonel Jacque's innocence is the factor that leads him to his misconception of the idea of being a complete gentleman. Because of his innocence, he knows nothing of the idea of being a gentleman. His misconception of the idea of being a complete gentleman is shaped as he wants to be a gentleman; while on the other hand, he does not know the proper manners owned by a complete gentleman. His innocence makes him take every action he considers as the attitude possessed by a gentleman. He does not know whether the action is really not the proper attitude possessed by a true gentleman.",
