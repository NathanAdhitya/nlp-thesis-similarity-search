  "title": "The Change of Alice Adams' character traits from Immaturity to maturity as seen booth Tarkington's Alice Adams",
  "abstract": "The thesis writer is curious to know the change of Alice Adams' character traits from being an immature woman to become a mature one in her thesis. Thus, in order to analyze the change of Alice's character traits, the thesis writer uses the theory of characterization and psychological theory on maturity. As an immature woman, Alice cannot accept the reality of her life and her family's condition. She does not admit that she is a poor woman. She cannot accept the reality both of her social economic condition and her low social status. Besides, Alice Adams cannot overcome her disappointment and cannot control her emotion well when she feels that her friends humiliate and insult her. However, the bankruptcy of her father's business and her failure to get Arthur's affection, make her think about her own future and become a mature woman. She begins to accept the reality and thinks realistically about her future by taking a stenography course in Frincke Business College.",
