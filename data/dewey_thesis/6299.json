  "abstract": "This is a Discourse Analysis on politeness strategies used by Lizzie McGuire in \"Lizzie McGuire\". Understanding politeness is very important in building a good relationship with other people in daily conversation (Brown and Levinson, 1987) and in showing awareness of another person?s public self-image (Yule, 1996). This encourages the writer to investigate about politeness strategies. In her study, the writer tries to find out the utterances which contain politeness strategies that Lizzie used toward the older people and people of the same age as her. In analyzing the data, the writer uses Brown and Levinson?s politeness strategies that are Bald on Record, Positive Politeness and Negative Politeness and Off Record. The approach used is qualitative approach. The source of the data of this study is the utterances which include the politeness strategies between Lizzie with the older people and people of the same age as her in which politeness strategy occurred. The writer finds out that in Lizzie?s conversation with the older people and people of the same age with her, Lizzie uses positive politeness as her most frequently used type of politeness strategy. It shows that Lizzie appreciates and wants to build a good relationship with the people she talks to.",
