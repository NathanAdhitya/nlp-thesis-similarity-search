  "abstract": "In this thesis, I focus on the characters? struggle against fate in Thomas Hardy?s Wessex Tales. I find that the four main characters: Matthaus Tina, Gertrude Lodge, George Barnet, and Charles Darton have some struggles against their fate. They struggle against fate because they cannot accept and surrender to their fate. I decide discuss the ways the main characters struggle against their fate as my topic. I need to use the literary approach and employ the literary theory especially the theory of conflict as the main tool to analyze the situations that show the characters? struggle against fate. In addition, I also use the theory of characterization to analyze the characters? thinking or action as their struggles when they fight against fate. Finally, as my finding, I see the four main characters struggle against fate but they cannot fight against fate. The important point is not the result of their struggle but their struggles and willingness to fight against fate. When they struggle against fate, they prove that they do not want to surrender to their fate.",
