  "abstract": "This thesis is about comparison between the codes used by the presenters on \"MTV 100% Indonesia\" and those used on \"MTV Most Wanted\". The writer is interested to find out the codes which occur on both programs, and to know the frequencies of the codes used by the presenters, and to find the similarities and differences of the codes used on both programs. In conducting his research, the writer recorded both programs and transcribed the utterances. In analyzing the data, the writer applied Holmes theory (1992) on Language Choice in Multilingual Communities (book: An Introduction to Sociolinguistics). From the research the writer finds out that the codes that occur on MTV 100% Indonesia are Standard Indonesian, Non-Standard Indonesian, and Standard English. While the codes occur on MTV Most Wanted are Standard Indonesian, Non-Standard Indonesian, Standard English and Non-Standard English. The writer also finds that both programs use the standard language more frequently than the non-standard one.",
