  "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of environmental behavior on individuals living with HIV/AIDS and its association with Psychosocial Problems. It focuses on the negative behavior which is exhibited by the environment towards individuals with HIV/AIDS, which can lead to adverse psychosocial outcomes. Psychosocial problems encompass the interaction between an individual's psychological well-being, social environment, and daily functioning, influenced by their environment and life events. The study acknowledges that external behavior plays a significant role in shaping internal behavior, and stressful events arising from negative external behavior can affect a person's internal well-being.

This work uses Social Cognitive theory to analyze the link of the effect of Psychosocial Problems with People Living with HIV/AIDS. As a result, this work highlights the profound impact of negative environmental behavior on individuals living with HIV/AIDS.
