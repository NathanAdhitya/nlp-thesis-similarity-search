  "abstract": "Candide is the main character in Candide who struggles with a problem of getting his goal. I focus my research on how Candide builds and uses social power in the society to achieve his goal, that is to get Miss Cunegund. I put my focus of analysis on the ways Candide builds and utilizes the social power in the society. The concept that I use to answer my research is from R. J. Rummelâ€™s social power. In the study, I discover that there are two ways to build social power that Candide does. The first is by getting close to the important people. The second is by doing charity in society. In building social power in the society, Candide acquires three types of power, namely authoritative power, bargaining power, and manipulative power. I also discover in how social power that Candide builds in society can help Candide get his goal. There are three ways how social power helps him. The first is by raising good status in the society. The next is by getting information in the society. Then the last way is by acquiring wealth in the society The analysis shows the social power can help Candide to achieve his goal, that is to get Miss Cunegund.",
