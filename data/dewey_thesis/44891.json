  "title": "Beautiful nightmares: the causes and effects of low self-esteem to Lara and Ayunindya's life",
  "abstract": "My screenplay Beautiful Nightmares is the story of Lara, a singer and Ayunindya, the assistant manager who both struggling with their self-esteem. Using crime as the genre of my story and Film Noir as the subgenre, I look into the worst nightmare of two persons with low self-esteem can bring to someone else. Since the main idea of my creative writing focuses on the causes and effects of low self-esteem, not only about how it turns out, I also deal with the roles of family and friends in influencing someone value of him or herself. This issue regarding low self-esteem is rarely noticed in the screenplay. However, I believe low self-esteem can cause a big nuisance, especially when it came to anxiety, obsession, violence and ended up with criminal behaviour. To help me creating this screenplay, I use the theory of The Looking Glass Self by Charles Horton Cooley, the theory of Self-Esteem and Adolescent by Morris Rosenberg, the theory of possession by L. Firestone, and Rosenbaum and DeCharms’ theory of criminal behaviour on someone with low self-esteem. As the plot goes by, it reveals how Lara and Ayunindya’s self-esteem is influenced by their family and friends. Furthermore, they ended up committing murder.",
