  "abstract": "The thesis writer discusses the theme of loneliness and alienation in Thomas Wolfe's Look Homeward, Angel through the main character's personality and conflicts. The society in which Eugene as the main character lives has been susceptible by materialism. It leads to greediness, selfishness and hypocrisy. Through this condition, the thesis writer would like to discuss Eugene's personality and his conflits, in reaction to his society. Being pressured in a materialistic society has influenced the development of Eugene's personali-ty and led to his conflicts. He becomes melancholic, strong-hearted, introverted, immaterialistic and furthermore he is trapped in conflicts. The thesis writer finds out that through his personality and conflicts he is alienated by his surroundings. Thus the thesis writer discovers that material-ism has caused the absence of love which becomes the reason of Eugene's loneliness and alienation as revealed through his personality and conflicts.",
