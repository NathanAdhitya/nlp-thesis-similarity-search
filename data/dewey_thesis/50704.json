  "abstract": "Bullying has already happened for a long time. Most of the cases leave the victims in a traumatic phase, which leads them to suffer several mental disorders, such as depression and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), which continue until the adult phase, and or even suicides. The worst part is those cases happen during the school period, which is a critical phase since it was the period where teenagers are in their phase to learn about themselves. However, although there are many bullying cases already coming out to the public, most people still did not know and did not understand well about bullying itself and the effects. Many victims also keep their mouths closed and tend to accept the bullying instead of face it off. This animation project purpose is to increase peopleâ€™s awareness and encourage the victims to face their bully but in a positive way.",
