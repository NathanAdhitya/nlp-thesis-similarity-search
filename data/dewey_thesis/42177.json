  "title": "The impact of the MSME's marketing to the customer satiisfaction in micro, small, and medium restaurant in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "The MSMEs have Jong been recognized as the most important agent of the economic growth as they cover 99% of total Indonesia's business, and provide more than 97% of Indonesia's total full employment. Among the MSMEs business sectors, the restaurant business has become one of the sectors that gives high contribution to Surabaya economy. In today's highly competitive business environment, scholar suggests that restaurant business, especially the micro, small, and medium sized restaurants need to pay more attention to their marketing practices in order to sustain. However, due to the unique characteristic and the limited resources that MSMEs are facing, it is inappropriate to assume that MSMEs can adopt the same marketing practices as the large enterprises. Research suggests that the MSME's marketing consists of four elements namely personal branding, perseverance, practice and co-production. Data that have been gathered and analyzed from the respondents showed that MSMEs marketing significantly influences the customer satisfaction in the micro, small, and medium restaurants in Surabaya.",
