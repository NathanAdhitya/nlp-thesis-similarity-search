  "title": "Danina's obstacles which prevent her from being united with her lover as seen in Daniele Steel's, Granny Dan",
  "abstract": "This thesis deals with popular novel, Granny Dan, which is written by Danielle Steel. It tells a story about a motherless girl who is taken by her father to a ballet school at the age of seven to live in the dormitory. One thing that interests me in choosing this novel is the main character, Danina Petroskova. Steel portrays her as a prima ballerina, has a great name and lives in high discipline. However, she dares to be in love with the Czar?s family?s doctor, who is already married. Here, this thesis is written to analyze the obstacles which prevent Danina to be united with her lover. In order to achieve the purpose in analyzing the topic, I use literary approach and use literary tools: characterization and conflict. In the analysis, I explain about kinds of Danina?s obstacles. I see that there are many obstacles she has to face in order to be united with the one she loves. First is Danina?s high dedication to her career in ballet. Second is Danina?s love to a married man. Third is Danina?s obedience to her mentor. Last is Danina?s sacrifice to leave Russia.",
