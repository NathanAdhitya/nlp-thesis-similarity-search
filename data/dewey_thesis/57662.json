  "abstract": "This thesis is a qualitative study on teacher's roles implemented by an American lecturer and an Indonesian lecturer in the English Department at Petra Christian University. The objectives of this study are to find out the teacher's roles, differences, and similarities that are implemented by both lecturers. This study was based on Harmer's theory on teacher's roles (2015). The data were collected from audio recording and transcript of the conversation in the classrooms twice for each lecturer in a total of four meetings for the analysis of this study. The findings show that the lecturers applied the teacher's roles: controller, monitor, prompter, editor, resource, and organizer. There were roles of evidence gatherer, tutor, and facilitator that were not implemented in both lecturers. Both lecturers played multiple roles in one utterance. For the differences, in the role of prompter, only AL who played prompter while IL did not. In conclusion, cultural background might not affect the differences of teacher’s roles because of the similar background of IL. Not only that, but the topic of reading passages might also affect the teacher’s roles that the lecturers play.",
