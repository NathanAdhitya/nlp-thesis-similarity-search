  "title": "The impact of marketing mix, environmental knowledge, environmental concern, and environmental attitude towards purchase intention in a case of The Body Shop Surabaya",
  "abstract": "The growing number of cosmetics brands force them to compete each other to gain customers' attention by implementing right marketing strategy, which is marketing mix. However, due to fear of environmental issues, consumers demand products that are produced in environmental friendly way; hence environmental aspects are important to determine purchase intention. One of well-known green cosmetics brands is The Body Shop (TBS). Therefore, this research is aimed to find out the impact of marketing mix, environmental knowledge, environmental concern, and environmental attitude towards purchase intention. This research is conducted by distributing questionnaires to people in Surabaya who have ever bought TBS in the store. The data was analyzed using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis. The result indicates marketing mix, environmental knowledge, concern, and attitude simultaneously have significant influence towards TBS's purchase intention in Surabaya. Partially only price; promotion, environmental' knowledge, concern, and attitude have significant influence towards purchase intention whereby environmental attitude is the most significant factor influencing purchase intention.",
