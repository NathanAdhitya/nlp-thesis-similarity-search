  "abstract": "In this research, I observed the differences and/or the similarities of the types and the functions of fillers produced by the first and the seventh semester students of the English Department, Petra Christian University, based on the length of studying time. The data were from the conversations of 20 students for each semester, in a role-play. The main theories used were from Rose (1998), Stenstrom (1994), Wu (2001), and Baalen (2001). Furthermore, I conducted this research in quantitative-descriptive approach. The findings show that the first semester students produced less fillers than the seventh semester students. Then, they produced unlexicalized filled pauses as the most frequently used type of fillers, followed by lexicalized filled pauses and silent pauses. They also produced fillers in order to fill the pause, to hesitate, to holding a conversation turn, to empathize, and to edit the term. Hesitating and filling the pauses are the most frequently used functions. However, mitigating function did not appear at all. The conclusion drew is there is no significant difference between the types and the functions of fillers used by the first and the seventh semester students due to there are a lot of significant similarities found.",
