  "abstract": "In this study, the writer investigated the types of misleading mistakes in four major stories of Love Actually movie. The writer also investigated the frequency of occurrence of each type of mistakes. The main theory used was Newmark?s (1993) theory of categorisation of translation mistakes. The writer also used the theory of referential meaning proposed by Nida and Taber (1982) in analysing the actual meaning of the dialogues. In her study, the writer used a descriptive qualitative approach. The writer analysed the English utterances and the Indonesian subtitles to find mismatch between them. The result of the analysis showed that the referential mistakes had the highest frequency of occurrence with the percentage of 77.78%. The writer found that subtitles containing referential mistakes had different meanings from the utterances. The writer also found that misleading mistakes occurred less with the percentage of 22.22%. These mistaken subtitles had the original meaning of the dialogue but were stated in incorrect spelling, choice of word and order.",
