  "abstract": "This study is focused on the speech acts in slogans and headlines of McDonald's' written advertisements. This study aimed to discover the illocutionary functions and the relationship between structural form and its communicative function. The source of this study's data is 24 written advertisements, as published on the website Bored Panda. This study's data are the 34 slogans and headlines found in the selected 24 McDonald's' printed publications. In this study, the writer used qualitative approach. The theories applied consist of speech act theory as the leading theory, supported by the methods of context and modes, body language, and copywriting. The findings reveal that representatives serve as the most frequent type regarding illocutionary functions, followed by expressive and directives. The absence of commissions indicates that using promises/threats to promote is not an excellent promotional strategy. Meanwhile, the absence of declarations indicates the copywriters' non-existent institutional roles to perform the act. Related to the relationship between the structural form and communicative function, all (34 out of 34) the speech acts have a direct link. It can be concluded that the copywriters use the ads to promote McDonald's products, branches, and facilities.",
