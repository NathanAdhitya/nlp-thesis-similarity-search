  "title": "A Study on Thomas Gradgrind's principle of utilitarianism in education and its effects on his children and students in Charles Dickens' Hard Times",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study concerning Thomas Gradgrind's education of facts and its effects on his children, Louisa and Tom, and his students, namely Bitzer and Cecillia Jupe in Dickens' Hard Times. To analyze and to support the analysis, the thesis writer uses library research, analytical method, and literary approach through the theory of characterization. She also uses the theory of utilitarianism as a support to explain the kind of education which is applied by Thomas Gradgrind on his children and students. According to the structure of the story, the analysis is done in two parts. The first part is \"sowing\" and the second part is \"reaping\". After exploring the ground of \"sowing\", the thesis writer considers that education which is done by Mr Gradgrind is extremely practical and factual. Then, having explored the ground of \"reaping\" she finds that the application of education of facts has brought destructive effects on Louisa, Tom, and Bitzer's characters. Meanwhile, the goodness of Sissy's character is used by Dickens to show the failure of utilitarian way of life. Thus, the thesis writer concludes that the result of Mr Gradgrind's education of facts finally ends in a failure which also means the failure of his utilitarian principle of life.",
