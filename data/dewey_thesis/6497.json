  "abstract": "For assuring the design of a produk, the design itself holds an important matter. As a designer, we face problems that we must create the strong design but must fullfil others points, like a light weight structure, competitive prizes, and many other point. Usually in the daily life, where the design is too strong and powerfull so that makes extra budget at the production process. In other hand, we also meet the opposite situation, when the design were sacrificed for the sake of production cost. In this calculation of the weighing bridge models, the finite element method based on ANSYS software were chosen because of the manual calculation were to difficult to solve the calculation and also takes longer time to accomplished. Meanwhile, Pugh?s concept selection method were chosen because of its efficiency for choosing the best solution from adequate solution that were born from the calculation. So we can choose the best solution based on this method, in both side, the strength of the structure and also the production cost. From the analysis based on ANSYS software and selection using the Pugh?s matrix selection, the result, the weighing bridge best build using I beam 500 x 200 (ASTM A-572) for the main structure and I beam 250 x 125 (ASTM A- 572) sebagai support beam",
