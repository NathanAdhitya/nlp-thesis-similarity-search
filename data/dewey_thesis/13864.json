  "title": "A Study of the main character's fight against injustice in Elizabeth Gaskell's Mary Barton",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of one of Elizabeth Gaskell's novels, Mary Barton, which is set in the industrial period. The study is about the injustice done by the masters to the workers. Injustice appears through discharging and decreasing the wages. In depression trade, the master thinks to get advantage of the workers' rights. In analyzing the novel, the thesis writer is going to use the theories of law, conflict, setting and characterization, to learn the motivation of the main character, John Barton, in fighting against the injustice. From the analysis, the writer finds out the motivation, the efforts, and the effects of John Barton's fight toward injustice. It can be seen that John Barton who has good character cannot accept the upper class's behaviour toward the lower class. He does some efforts that finally give two results: to the society, a better condition, and to himself, he must pay all of his efforts through death.",
