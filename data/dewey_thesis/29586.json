  "abstract": "This study aims to discuss how princesses in Disney animation series are developing in accordance with the concept of women in the society. Since the concept of woman in society is changing throughout time, the characteristics of the princesses in Disney animation series are also developing. I categorized the princesses into three generations based on their characteristics which picture them as ideal women in certain era. Therefore, I will use the concept of the Angel in the House, the concept of Feminism, and the concept of Girl Power. The concept of Angel in the House is applied to discuss that the princesses from the first generation are pictured having submissiveness and domesticity. The concept of Feminism is applied to discuss that the princesses from the second generation are pictured showing their equalities with men in terms of abilities, knowledge, and power. The concept of Girl Power is applied to discuss the princesses from the third generation who have assertiveness. In my thesis, I find that Disney applied the concept of women in the society to the characteristics of the princesses. The reason why it possibly happens is to keep the number of the audiences so that it can increase the companyâ€™s profit. The concept of love is also changing from romantic love between man and man to family love between family members.",
