  "title": "Brida's psychosocial problems and self teratment in Paulo Coelho's Brida",
  "abstract": "Brida is a novel by Paulo Coelho which tells about a 21 year old girl who learns magic. Since she experienced some psychosocial crises, Brida has to face some problems that appear because of those crises. Thus, through this thesis, I analyze the problems that she faces through her journey in learning magic. I also analyze the ways that Brida does in order to overcome the problems. To analyze Brida?s psychosocial problems and her ways to overcome them, I use the theory of psychosocial crises by Erik H. Erikson to support the analysis because it is the most appropriate theory that can help me to find out the answers. However, through this analysis, I finally find out the problems in the five stages that Brida faces, such as the trust versus mistrust, autonomy versus shame and doubt, initiative versus guilt, industry versus inferiority, and identity versus role confusion stage. Also, I find out the ways that Brida does to overcome her problems in each stage, such as to be and share oneself, think positively and reflect the things she can believe, increase self-esteem, and hear the inner voices.",
