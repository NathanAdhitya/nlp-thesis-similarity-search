  "abstract": "Everything That Rises Must Converge is the title of O?Connor?s second and last collection of short stories which contains eight short stories, but the writer only discusses three of them: `Everything That Rises Must converge?, \"A view of The Woods?, and The Comforts of Home?. in the thesis writer?s analysis, she uses the literary and psychological theories of conflict to analyze the conflicts that take place in family relationships especially between the children and the parents in order to find the different perceptions that they have. But since both sides cannot solve the conflicts, both the children and the parents get the fatal results. Then, the thesis writer concludes her findings that the child-parental conflicts due to different perceptions have brought the fatal results.",
