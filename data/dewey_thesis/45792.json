  "title": "The impact of macroeconomic indicators toward foreign direct investment: a case study on Indonesia",
  "abstract": "For the past few decades, foreign direct investment has been seen as one of the main drivers of economic growth in developing countries. This study aims to analyze the impact of macroeconomic indicators (trade openness, gross domestic product, interest rate, exchange rate, and inflation rate) toward foreign direct investment in Indonesia. Judgment purposive sampling was used, and data from 1987 to 2014 was regressed. This study finds that gross domestic product has a significant positive impact, and the exchange rate has a substantial adverse effect on foreign direct investment in Indonesia. They are using multiple regression analysis on the time series data. On the other hand, trade openness, interest rate and inflation rate do not have a significant impact on foreign direct investment in Indonesia.",
