  "title": "What problems expatriate managers face when working with Indonesian human resources, how to handle this?",
  "abstract": "The main Idea behind this report is how to maintain a more pleasant working environment between two cultures which human resources from those are interacting with each other on a daily basis. One side is expatriate managers working and living in Indonesia and the other party are the Indonesians. The concept of harmony in the Javanese/Indonesian community is a core concept, notwithstanding outbursts of uncontrolled emotion that may occasionally be displayed; this characteristic can be inferred from frequent occurrence of conflict-avoidance responses and a pleasant group climate. This is causing a communication barrier as most issues specially those with a negative tone will not be discussed.",
