  "abstract": "Boiler Turbine Generator (BTG) is one of the unit in P.T. Sasa Inti that produces steams, where steams are used in the processing of Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), as well as to generate the electricity with maximal power of 5170KW. Steams produced by the boiler was prioritized for the processing of MSG, thus electricity produced by the generator was inconstant depending upon the amount of steams needed to produce the MSG. BTG in its functioning is supported by several system, which some of the system are protective system and control system. Protective system are needed to avoid generator from any damage caused by disturbances that might be happen, and control system are needed to control BTG in the process. The example of control system are steam pressure control system, and temperature steam control system. In order to produce steams, several inputs are needed for the conversion of electrical energy within the BTG, which covers water, fuel, and air for burning process. The inputs for BTG every 1 KWh which generated by the generator are : * Oil Fuel : 0.923 kg/KWh * Air for burning process :10.9m 3 /KWh * Water : 10.96 kg/KWh",
