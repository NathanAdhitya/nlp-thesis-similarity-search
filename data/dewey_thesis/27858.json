  "title": "Refusal strategies used by the old and the young foremen in a bakery in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "This study is mainly about the refusal strategies used by an old foreman and a young foreman in refusing request permission made by the workers. Specifically, it focuses on the comparison between how the old and young foremen employed the refusal strategies in refusing request. The data were taken by recording dialogues of the old foreman and the young foreman. The data were analyzed by the theory of refusal strategies proposed by Beebe et al (1990). The findings show that both the old foreman and the young foreman mostly employed indirect strategy. However, there are some differences between them. The first difference is that the old foreman used statement of alternative more, meanwhile the young foreman used expression of excuse, reason and explanation. Secondly, the young foreman used direct strategy more than the old foreman did. Another difference is that the old foreman employed three strategies only whereas the young foreman used four refusal strategies. The similarity they shared is that they both used indirect strategies.",
