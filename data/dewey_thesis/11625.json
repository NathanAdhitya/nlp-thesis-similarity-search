  "abstract": "Jimmy Munday and Ruby, the main Aboriginal characters in No Sugar and Murras, possess ambivalent attitude toward the Whites. They mimic and reject the Whites at the same time. The writer of this thesis is triggered to discuss one topic, mimicry and ambivalence that are done by Jimmy Munday and Ruby in her thesis. She reveals how and why both main characters experience mimicry and ambivalence. In discovering the process and the causes of Jimmy?s and Ruby?s mimicry and ambivalence, cultural approach is applied in this analysis. Homi K. Bhabha?s postcolonialism theory, which is mimicry, is used to reveal the answers to her statement of the problem. Jimmy and Ruby have to mimic the Whites, yet they also feel the hatred that enables them to reject the Whites? culture. Therefore, both of them experience ambivalence toward the Whites. Moreover, poor and powerless conditions are actually the causes of Jimmy?s and Ruby?s mimicry and ambivalence. Surprisingly, the root of the poor and powerless conditions is the Whites. Thus, at the end of this analysis, the writer of this thesis can conclude that mimicry and ambivalence are done by Jimmy Munday and Ruby.",
