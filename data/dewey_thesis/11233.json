  "abstract": "In order to compete with other restaurant, a restaurant must have the standard of operational procedures (S.O.P.) to achieve the high quality, maintain, control and increase the satisfaction of the customers. S.O.P. arranges all the duties of the employees in order to operate the restaurant effectively. An organization can be told to be effective if it can apply its S.O.P in running its business. (Steers 1977: 149) In this case China House is the organization that is analyzed. What is S.O.P.? What is organizational effectiveness? What is the China House S.O.P.? How does the S.O.P. in China House influence its organizational effectiveness? What will the ideal S.O.P. for China House be? These questions are answered in this thesis.
