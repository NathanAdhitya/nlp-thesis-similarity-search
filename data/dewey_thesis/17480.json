  "title": "The utilization of kalimantan's peat soil to make lightweight bricks",
  "abstract": "Kalimantan is dominated by large swamp area and the depth of it is different Cause of that, developing of this area depend on solve of problems on it Technically, the solving of problem on swamp area is hard. The alternative of solution should be using materials in that area. Brick is one alternative to solve the peat problem using the peat's characteristics. This experiment used the composition of the peat content percentage in the brick, the varieties of the temperature, and longer of the burning to know the strength, water absorption and dry density. Analysis of brick is using experimental design, 2* factorial designs.",
