The theory that the writer used to analyze this research is from Van Ek’s theory. It is a theory about speech functions and its types of speech functions. By using the descriptive method, the writer calculated some statistic data to form a descriptive conclusion. The finding that Indonesian people expect is that He would give them an answer about the continuation of that case. However, the imparting and seeking factual information is the most frequent type that occurs in the script. People expect that there should be many sentences that showed what he has done for that case. It did not happen. Therefore, Indonesian people are not satisfied with SBY’s speech at that time.",
