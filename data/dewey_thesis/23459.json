  "title": "The Study of theme in Ernest Hemingway's a farewell to arms through linguistic approach",
  "abstract": "Based on literary critics, Ernest Hemingway's A Fare-well to Arms is a novel which has three themes (War, Love, Death). Each of the five books of the novel has one dominant theme. There is an argumentation about the most dominant theme of the novel among the critics. Applying both linguis- tic and literary theories, the writer would like to find the solution for the argumentation. She also wants to analyze the dominant theme of each book linguistically. Using linguistic approach, the writer does the analysis by making use of language of the novel, in this case, lexi- cal items to find the most dominant theme. Lexical items are analyzed to find out motifs since motifs are the elements which constitute themes. The most dominant theme is consti- tuted by the most recurring motifs. At last, the result of the analysis shows that 'War' is dominant in Book I to Book I11 and 'Love' is dominant in Book IV and Book V. It is based on the theme which has more recurring motifs than the other themes in each book. It is also found out that 'War' is the most dominant theme of the novel since 'War' has the most recurring motifs.",
