  "title": "A Study of the linguistic repertoire and the domains of language use of the second and the third generations of a totok chinese family",
  "abstract": "This study is a qualitative study about linguistic repertoire and domains of language use and the subjects are three persons from two different generations of a totok Chinese family consisting of the father, the mother and the first daughter. This study was conducted in order to see the linguistic repertoire of each subject. Moreover, this study would explain the reason behind the language choice of the subject for one domain. In order to reach the research objectives, I used the theories of linguistic repertoire, domains of language use, social factors and the theory of qualitative study. From my study, I found that linguistic repertoire of the father is Mandarin, Hokkien, Javanese and Indonesian; the linguistic repertoire of the mother is Indonesian, Javanese, Mandarin and Hokkien; while the linguistic repertoire of the first daughter is Indonesian, English, Javanese and Mandarin. I could see that linguistic repertoire of each subject could be distinct one from another and it was influenced by the family, education and environment he/she was exposed to. In addition, the language choice of someone might show both his/her linguistic repertoire and the social factors why he/ she choose to use certain language at that time. Thus, linguistic repertoire of someone was interrelated with the domains of language use.",
