  "title": "Developing the suitable standard service working procedure in order to gain efficiency and effectiveness of work in Bouvigne Paradijs Restaurant",
  "abstract": "The objective of this thesis is creating a standard service working procedure in order to gain effectiveness and efficiency of work. The writers have chosen this topic because at this moment, the restaurant has no “ real” standard of service (based on 7 months working experience in this restaurant), which is resulting in low performing of service quality performance and ineffectiveness and inefficiency of work. This working situation (working without a standard) also has turned into a potential problem for the restaurant because it has direct influences both on restaurant’s daily operation and the guest satisfaction. The writers analyzed the problems at the current situation in the restaurant, and focused on the service area (reservation process, mise en place, and in dining process). In the research part, the writers implemented field analysis system with questionnaires, interview, comparisons between theory and the current situation in the restaurant. The result of this research will be used as a tool to find the suitable standard of service that can be implemented by the restaurant.",
