  "abstract": "The research focuses on line architecture design methodology analysis and kanban implementation to increase efficiency coefficient RSX production line at PT Schneider Electric Manufacturing Batam. Line architecture design methodology is used to links between Schneider production system rules and industrial process design approach in lean principle. The research results showed RSX production line of material flow and layout of the RSX sub assembly line needs to be changed to maintain efficiency coefficient.",
