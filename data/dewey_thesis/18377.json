  "abstract": "This thesis deals mainly with the causes of cultural conflict between Lapham and Corey and the resolution of their cultural conflict. Lapham and Corey, the focus of my analysis, are the main and the minor characters in Howell?s The Rise of Silas Lapham. Through this study, I would like to find out the causes of the cultural conflict between Lapham and Corey who represent the aristocratic and bourgeoisie culture. In addition, I aim to know how Lapham and Corey resolve this conflict. For this analysis I use cultural approach which includes the cultural conflict theory and the cultural conflict resolution as the main tools. Then in my analysis, I find out that the causes of Lapham?s and Corey?s cultural conflict are the dominance of aristocratic culture, the cultural ignorance and the different cultural perspective. However, this conflict brings disadvantages for both of them and creates uncomfortable situation toward one another. It leads Lapham and Corey to resolve their cultural conflict. Accordingly, my analysis is able to reveal Lapham?s and Corey?s efforts to resolve conflict between them which by advancing their relationship, and accepting and respecting their differences. By doing that Lapham and Corey can put the end of the cultural conflict between them.",
