  "abstract": "This is a qualitative study of questions and instructions found in reading sections used in Interlanguage: English for Senior High School Students XI textbook. In this study, the writer observed the types of cognitive domains of questions and instructions and the keywords found in the reading sections of the textbook. The data, consisting of questions and education, were collected from the reading sections of the first seven chapters of the textbook as the source of data. To answer the research questions, the writer used the theory of Bloomâ€™s Revised Taxonomy as proposed by Anderson and Krathwohl (2001). The findings revealed the six types of cognitive domains of questions and instructions found in the reading sections of the textbook: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. The findings also revealed the keywords of each cognitive domain of questions and instructions. This study was a small scale one, which involved queries and instructions found in reading sections used in the textbook. Hopefully, it can be of some help for other researchers who want to do similar research on questions and instructions found in another manual.",
