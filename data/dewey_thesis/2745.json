  "abstract": "In-Store Media is a newcomer in Indonesian, but already become a serious player in advertising industry. Their main business is putting advertisements in every supermarket or hypermarket around Indonesia. Nestle and Unilever are the example of big companies who use In-Store Media as their advertising media, whether to promote their new product to potential customers or to strengthen their existing brand in the market. The question now is \"How can an advertising media like In-Store Media can compete with other advertising media that already have put down their roots strongly such as: TV, radio, and magazine?\" The author tries to answer this question by combining the theory from books with the experience that he got from his internship in ActMedia (the In-Store Media advertising agency). In this Final Assignment Report, the author will give basic knowledge of the advertising industry and several key terms in the industry that must be known to be able to understand the whole discussion in this paper. Basic theories like below the line and above the line advertising or key theories like Share of Voice and Cost per Thousand are discussed in this dissertation. The author will answer the problem by using the case study research method.",
