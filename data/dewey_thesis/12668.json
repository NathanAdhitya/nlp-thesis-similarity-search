  "title": "A Study on the effects of Jimmy Porter's Anger in John Osborne's look back in Anger",
  "abstract": "Look Back in Anger, Osborne's most famous play, is intended to reflect his dissatisfaction toward his society because of the existence of the division of the classes. He puts Jimmy Porter as his spokesman in reflecting his feeling toward the class fraction by furnishing Jimmy with his anger toward everything, especially toward the people around him. This thesis analyzes Jimmy's anger and its effects on Jimmy himself and on his relationship with his companion. Since anger is Jimmy's tool to reflect his dissatisfaction toward his society, Jimmy does not realize that he has made his wife, Alison, and Cliff, his best friend, as the objects of his wrath. In consequence of this anger, he cannot maintain his relationship with his companion who leaves him one after another. It is because of his bitterness and anger that he has destroyed the relationship with people who really love him. Although at the end Jimmy is reunited with Alison, they can live in harmony only if they refuge to their fantasy world.",
