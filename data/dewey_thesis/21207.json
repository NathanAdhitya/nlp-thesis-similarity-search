  "abstract": "This thesis is an analysis about the attitudes toward life that cause the failures of some of Katherine Anne Porter's characters in Ship of Fools.The thesis writer is curious to know whether the characters in the novel fail because of their ways of life,and how these attitudes toward life lead them to their failures.From the discus - sion,it is found out that what is seen from the charac - ters'outward appearance is different from their inside qualities.All characters seem to be successful but they fail due to their negative mental attitudes toward them - selves and toward other people.Their negative mental attitudes toward life,among others are the lack of self- confidence,the lack of responsibility,and the lack of love.Finally,it is proved that the four characters fail due to their negative mental attitudes.",
