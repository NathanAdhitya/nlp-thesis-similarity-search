  "abstract": "Now, SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC MANUFACTURING BATAM (SEMB) needed to increase their production capacity with adding a new building. This final assignment contents the using of IDOV (Identify, Design, Optimize, and Verify) methodologies from DFSS (Design for Six Sigma) at SMB project relocation. The objective using IDOV, help accomplish the project requirement from customer (PEL, and VSD department) on the relocation phase during implementation. Scheduling and qualify mover company are key of this project. Relocation starts on 26th March, 2007.until early April 2007. The using of this methodologies is enough simple, by input the lead-time each production line and tracking the schedule base on actual condition during implementation. Microsoft Project with Gantt chart helps to arrange the steps and relation each production line. The final is evaluating the actual condition against the design phase and see the problem factor during relocation with DOE (Design of Experiment).as study case.",
