  "title": "Insecurity and self-acceptance portrayed in Samsung Galaxy A8 advertisement “Lets You Be You”: a multimodal analysis",
  "abstract": "Advertisement is an important business tool that enables companies to promote their product, as well as deliver a message to its viewers. In order to do so, the verbal and nonverbal expression is used. In this research, I aim to discover how Samsung addresses the issue of insecurity and self-acceptance in their video advertisement entitled “Galaxy A8: Official Digital Film - Lets You Be You”. To reveal the meaning of both verbal and nonverbal expressions, I use Paltridge’s theory of multimodal discourse analysis, and Pease’s theory of body language to help me analyze the data. I use a qualitative approach in doing this research because the approach itself is applicable for interpreting both verbal and nonverbal data. I begin the analysis by watching the video, then compiling the transcript and screenshots into a table. Next, I analyze the data that are divided into two major points. Based on my analysis, I find that the issues portrayed in the advertisement can be seen through verbal and nonverbal reactions of the interviewees. Through the video advertisement, Samsung is a company which encourages people to love themselves. In conclusion, Samsung is a company which encourages self-love to people across the globe.",
