They are consideration between New Brand or Extension, the Brand Presentation, and Parent?s Influence. The writer conducts focus group discussions with several Dutch children to gain insight on children?s perceptions towards brands, their attitudes and preferences about fashion and branding, and factors important in branding for children market. The research is qualitative and exploratory. Thus, from the focus group discussion, added with literature reviews regarding brand extension strategies, branding for children, and focus group strategy with children, this dissertation can come to a conclusion that may give beneficial recommendations towards companies willing to enter the children?s fashion market.",
