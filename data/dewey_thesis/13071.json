  "title": "A Study of the main male character's process of changing his ideal in William Faulkner's the unvanquished",
  "abstract": "This thesis is about the process of changing ideal which can be seen through the character of Bayard Sartoris in William Faulkner's The Unvanquished. In order to know the process of Bayard's changing ideal from the Southern code of vengeance to the Christian code of forgiveness and love, the thesis writer analyzes the characterization of Bayard Sartoris in relation to the Southern code of vengeance and the Christian code of forgiveness and love. She also analyzes his outer conflicts; his conflicts against his stepmother and the society. From Bayard's inner conflicts, the thesis writer finds out the process of his changing ideal which is revealed in his making decision. The thesis writer finally concludes that people, especially the loved ones, have a significant role in shaping one's character and attitudes. However, it does not lessen the importance of one's own decision. Through the outer and inner conflicts that one undergoes, one can finally decide to change his ideal to a better one.",
