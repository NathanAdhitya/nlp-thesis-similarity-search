  "title": "Deconstruction of male and female characters’ qualities in Zootopia",
  "abstract": "This research aims to analyze the representation of male and female characters’ qualities that are portrayed in a movie called Zootopia, as well as how the qualities are gradually deconstructed in the movie. The writer is also interested in doing a critical reading by deconstructing the deconstruction in the movie to show that there is no single fixed meaning to interpret a film. In order to support the analysis, the writer uses two theories which are Gender Roles and Deconstruction. In this analysis, the writer finds that the representation of qualities in Zootopia follows the traditional gender stereotypes in “Gender Roles”, where men are considered superior to women. However, as the story progresses, the writer finds that the qualities in the movie are gradually deconstructed, showing that women are superior to men. After deconstructing the deconstruction in the movie, the writer finds that meaning can “disseminate” or can be perceived in different ways. Furthermore, from the analysis, the writer finds that both oppositions are actually interdependent to each other and complement as a whole. This means neither of the oppositions is stronger or weaker than the other.",
