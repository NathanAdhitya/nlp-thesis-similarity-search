The speech on “Generation Unlimited”, was aimed to help young people all over the world to help end bullying and violence by sharing kind notes. In conducting the research, the writer used the theory proposed by George Yule (1996) completed by the related theory by O’Keeffe, Clancy, and Adolphs (2011). The findings reveal various intentions through the illocutionary acts and the impacts through the written responses as the perlocution. The intentions through the representative acts were to inform people about his struggles in the past. The intentions through the directive acts were to get the audience to begin speaking up and expressing what they believed.

In conclusion, Kim Namjoon’s speech at the 2018 United Nations General Assembly resulted in inspiring and motivating impacts on the audience viewed from their written responses.",
