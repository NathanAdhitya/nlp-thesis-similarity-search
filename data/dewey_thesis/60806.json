  "title": "Politeness strategies used by Emily Cooper to her boss and work colleagues in Emily in Paris",
  "abstract": "This qualitative research study was conducted to analyze the politeness strategies used by Emily Cooper to her boss and work colleagues throughout season 3 of the Netflix series Emily in Paris, specifically within the business context. The main theory used is Watts’ second order politeness strategy (2003) that is elaborated with the politeness strategy theory by Brown and Levinson’s (1987). The findings indicate that Emily Cooper used more politeness sub strategies to her boss who has a higher social status than hers rather than to her work colleagues who has the same social status as hers, despite not including the non verbal communication analysis into the study. Additionally, the findings revealed that the politeness strategy Emily Cooper does not use to her boss, whereas she used it to her work colleagues out of the four politeness strategies, is the off record politeness strategy. In conclusion, in this study the politeness strategies are used by Emily Cooper to both her boss and work colleagues in the series Emily in Paris season 3 depending on the social status of the person she is talking to during communicating about work.",
