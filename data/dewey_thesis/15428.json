  "title": "Peningkatan kualitas jasa pelayanan taksi di Surabaya menuju taksi bernuansa wisata",
  "abstract": "As the second biggest town in Indonesia and also the capital of East Java province, Surabaya is now developing, particularly in the field of transportation. Now Surabaya has many kinds of public transportations ,one of them is the taxi. Taxis, if compared to other public transportations, have specific characteristics such as their speed, their accuracy, their comfort, and their security. Many taxis are used by middle to high-class people. It is because the fare is more expensive than that of other transportations. Eventhough the service quality of taxis in Surabaya is good enough, it still needs to be improved to create a higher service quality and to satisfy their customers. To improve the service quality taxis companies can reach it through setting up special taxis for tourists.Nowadays , taxis for tourists only exist in Jakarta. By operating taxis for tourists, their service quality will be more focused on the tourist's needs. Therefore, it is expected that the service quality of taxis in Surabaya may be improved towards the level of taxis for tourists.",
