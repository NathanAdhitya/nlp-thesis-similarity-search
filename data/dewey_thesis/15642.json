  "title": "A Study of character change in Thomas Fowler in Graham Greene's the Quiet American",
  "abstract": "This thesis analyzes the freedom of Thomas Fowler, the main character in Graham Greene's The Quiet American. The writer wants to show that Fowler undergoes a change in character as a result of the new experiences he has. These new experiences are brought about by the choices which he has freely made. The analysis shows that at the beginning of the novel, Fowler is described as a person who is uninvolved, selfish, indecisive and does not care about other people. He goes through many experi-ences as a result of his choices which he has freely made. The choices that he makes are connected with his relationships to people like his wife in London, Helen; his mistress in Vietnam, Phuong; and his friend in Vietnam, Alden Pyle. He also makes choices in relation to his work as a journalist. At the end of the novel, as a result of his experiences, Fowler becomes involved, unselfish, decisive and he now cares about other people.",
