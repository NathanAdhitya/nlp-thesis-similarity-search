  "abstract": "This study entitled “Request Strategies Used by Five Street Dance Groups Leaders to Male and Female Members in the Meeting” was done to know the influence of the gender toward the request made by the leaders in the street dance groups’ meetings. The writer observed five young male leaders of five different street dance groups in making request to the male and female members in the meeting. The writer used the theory from Trosborg (1995) to classify the request uttered by the leaders. He found that the leaders mostly used the same request strategy, which is direct strategy to both male and female members in the meetings. Among direct strategy, the leaders mostly used imperatives and ellipical phrases to male members while obligation statement is the most substrategy in direct strategy used to the female members. He also found that the leaders used more indirect strategies, such as mild hints to the female than the male members probably because the leaders tried to be more polite to the female members.",
