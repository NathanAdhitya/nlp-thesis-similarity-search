  "title": "The Black Mirror-stories: a short story collection highlighting the beauty penalty phenomenon in the Indonesian society",
  "abstract": "Beauty penalty has been a phenomenon which occurs in society as it imposes disadvantages on attractive people. However, as this phenomenon has been merely acknowledged from one individual’s testimony to the other without further study, the majority of people still ignore this phenomenon. Despite its prevalence and significance, the beauty penalty phenomenon lacks deeper discussion. In response to this reality, this thesis explores the triggers to beauty penalty and multiple forms which the beauty penalty affects one’s life while adhering to the concept of perceived entitlement by Margaret Lee et al., the concept of unmet expectations by Catherine Eckel and Rick Wilson, and the concept of beauty penalty forms by Stephen Marson and Joanne Hessmiller. I explore this topic by producing a short story collection to show others’ perceived entitlement and unmet expectations of the attractive protagonists as the triggers to beauty penalty occurrence. In addition, the work shows that the beauty penalty phenomenon can manifest in forms such as social penalties, mental problems, emotional disturbances, and physical challenges. Thus, the protagonists must face their own forms of beauty penalty to achieve their goals.",
