  "title": "Linguistic approach to the study of theme in Ernest Hemingway's the Old Man and the Sea",
  "abstract": "Based on literary critic, Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man And the Sea is a novel which has three distinctive themes, those are Christian, Nature, and Code Hero. The three themes are stated as equally dominant. From literary point of view, the statement seems right because each of those themes can become the themes of the novel. However, whether they are equally dominant or not if they are seen from linguistic point of view is still a question. Here, the writer would like to find out whether the themes of a novel can be analyzed linguistically and whether the result of her research is the same as what the literary critic says. In doing the research, she uses just the linguistic data which means she applies the theory of stylistics by using lexical items as the data. Those data are analysed further in order to find out the motifs and the numbers of recurring motifs from where she comes up to the findings and interpretation of the findings to reach the most dominant theme of this novel. After the writer has analysed the motifs and counted up the total ocourance of motifs constituting each theme, she gets the final result. It shows that the theme Nature with the biggest number of motifs occurance is said as the most dominant theme of this novel.",
