  "title": "Factors influencing the behaviour intention to adopt digital banking (a case of Jenius)",
  "abstract": "With the increasing digitalization rate in Indonesia, banks have started to provide digitized services through digital banking applications. To be accepted by consumers, digital banking should acknowledge the factors affecting behavioral intention to adopt digital banking. The research mainly based its theoretical foundation on the research conducted by Tan and Lau (2016), which evaluated Millennial’s intention to adopt mobile banking by analyzing four factors, namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and perceived risk. Trust is also included in the model due to its importance in influencing behavioral intention. Jenius will be the research object as it was ranked “The Best Digital Bank in Indonesia 2018”. The participants of this research come from the Millennial and Generation Z as they are the target market of Jenius. The research’s data is collected through questionnaires, which is then analyzed by using Structural Model Equation through IBM SPSS AMOS. Results indicated that performance expectancy, social influence, and trust have a significant positive relationship to behavioral intention to adopt digital banking. In contrast, perceived risk has a meaningful negative association with the later. Although effort expectancy has no considerable impact on behavior intention, it is found that effort expectancy influences performance expectancy positively and significantly.",
