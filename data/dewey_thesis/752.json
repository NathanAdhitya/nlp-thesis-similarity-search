  "abstract": "The Writer carries out a research for her thesis entitled the study of ambiguity in the articles of Hello English magazine because she is interested in knowing whether the ambiguity appears in Hello English magazine. This thesis is limited to the articles, which are written by the free-lance writers in Hello English magazine published on February 2001 to April 2001 editions. The problems, which come up in this study are which structurally ambiguous sentences are, and which lexically ambiguous sentences are by looking at the deep structures of both types of ambiguity, and how the occurrence of ambiguous sentences in the articles of Hello English magazine are. In this study, the writer uses a qualitative method because she wants to analyze the ambiguous sentences using the theory that she has. In doing this study, she does not concern about the reason why the ambiguity occurs. For the analysis, the writer uses theory of Radford's and Bornstein's transformational grammar by generating the deep structures using tree diagrams and the theory of Jacobs' and Rosenbaum's on lexical features as additional theory. After getting the findings, which she finds ten types of structural ambiguity and three types of lexical ambiguity, she concludes the findings. In the conclusion she finds that the structural ambiguity appears more than the lexical ambiguity.",
