  "title": "The Comparison of swearwords used by the first and seventh semester Samarindanese students of Petra Christian University",
  "abstract": "Samarinda has no native language. So, it also means that Samarindanese does not have their own native swearwords like Surabayanese who have \"Jancuk\" as their own swearwords. That is why the writer finds it interesting to study the choice of swearwords that are used by the Samarindanese students in their conversation while they are studying in Petra Christian University. This thesis was conducted to compare and find out the differences of the swearwords which are used by the first and seventh semester Samarindanese students of Petra Christian University. The writer mainly based this thesis on the theory from Rothwell (1973), which separates swearwords into 5 categories, namely copulative terms, excretory terms, human genital terms, sexual irregularities term, and animal terms. The writer got the data by recording the conversation of the first and seventh semester Samarindanese students in Petra Christian University. The result of this thesis indicates that the first semester Samarindanese students mostly used Samarindanese swearwords, like \"anjing\" from the animal term,w hile the seventh semester mostly used Javanese swearwords like \"jancuk\" from the copulative term because they have been affected by their surroundings, which is Javanese.",
