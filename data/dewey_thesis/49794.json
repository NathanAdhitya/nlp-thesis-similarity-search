  "title": "Adolf Hitler's narcissistic personality disorder in Mein Kampf",
  "abstract": "This research is intended to find symptoms of Adolf Hitler the character’s narcissistic personality disorder in Mein Kampf as well as the reason why the character suffers from such disorder. In order to do so, I have used Otto F. Kernberg’s theory on pathological narcissistic personality disorder. The symptoms of the character’s narcissism can be found from his self, his emotional life and his social functioning, all of those showing similarities to Kernberg’s description of narcissistic patients. On the other hand, the character’s authoritarian parental figure and innate talent are the reasons behind such mental disorder. After the analysis, I have found that despite being a non-fiction, autobiography can be analyzed like other fictional texts. Furthermore, from the analysis, I also found that narcissistic personality disorder is the reason behind the character’s ruthless view and thus, should be regarded seriously.",
