  "abstract": "The writing of this thesis would like to find out the differences of politeness strategies by a male and a female in their use of language by the theory of Brown and Levinson. In analyzing the data, the writer will use \"Private Lives\" , a play by Noel Coward. This play is the story of misadventures caused by an exchange of of husbands and wives. In analyzing data, the writer only chooses two characters, Elyot and Amanda. These reasons are this two speakers talk more than the others, the number of their utterances is almost equal, and the play focuses more on their problem. The writer finds out through this play that both of them use more on positive politeness than nega-tive politeness. However, the male uses more posi-tive politeness than the female. It shows that the male uses more polite strategies than the female. However the differences of politeness strategies which is used by them is not great because they come from the same status.",
