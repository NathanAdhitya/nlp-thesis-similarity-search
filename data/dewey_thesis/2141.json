  "title": "A Study of central figures in Hendrik Ibsen's plays",
  "abstract": "The presentation of the heroes and heroines in Ibsen's early, middle and later plays is undeniably different. In the early plays, the central figures, as represented by Brand and Peer Gynt, stand as super human beings who in following their extreme desires perform all the incredible deeds in their own imaginative worlds. In the middle plays, the central figures, as represented by Nora, Mrs. Alving and Dr. Stockrnann are the midelle class people who struggle against the false values of society for truth and freedom. And in the later plays, the central figures, as represented by Solness, Borkman and Rubek, are mystical frustrated central figures, who gain triumph over their wasted lives through their death. However, beyond all the differences there is one characteristic that makes all Ibsen's central figures similar to one another. The similarity that unites all these central figures is that all of them stand as individuals.",
