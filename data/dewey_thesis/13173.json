  "abstract": "In his novel Lord Jim, Conrad describes human psychological problem which appears in his main character Jim The major theme of Lord Jim is Jim?s search for his true redemption. Therefore, with the theories of characterization, conflict, and redemption as well as psychological and psychoanalytical theories, the writer tries to analyze the process of Jim?s search for redemption to gain his honor as well a s the proofs that Jim?s death is the only redemption for him The analysis shows that Jim has undergone some stages in his search for redemption. They are becoming a wanderer, becoming a temporary hero of the natives at Patusan, and becoming a real hero for himself throngh the way he dies. Moreover, Jim?s death is justifiable as his true redemption, since Jim?s death is the redemption of his courage, honor, and guilt. From the analysis, the writer views that Jim?s search for redemption is meaningful because, at last, he can fmd his true redemption in which he gains his honor.",
