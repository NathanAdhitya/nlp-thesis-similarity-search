  "title": "A Study of satire on the literary, political and social condition of the society as seen in Smollett's peregrine pickle",
  "abstract": "This thesis concerns on the study of satire on the literary, political and social conditions of the society through Smollett?s characterization of Peregrine Pickle in his novel Peregrine Pickle. Smollett uses Peregrine Pickle as a tool to criticize the attitudes of the upper class people at the eighteenth century. Since satire is a hind of writing that criticizes something or somebody, the thesis writer is curious to know what Smollett wants to satirize on the literary, political and social conditions at that time. Through the analysis of Peregrine Pickle?s character the thesis writer finds Smollett?s satires on the literary, political and social conditions. The literary conditions Smollett satirizes are the conditions of the school, the subject, the teachers, and the students as well. The political conditions Smollett satirizes are the conditions of the political game, the behaviour of the politician club members, and the failure of some people in politics. The social conditions Smollett satirizes are the conditions of the strangers, the social climbers, and the snobbish upper class people.",
