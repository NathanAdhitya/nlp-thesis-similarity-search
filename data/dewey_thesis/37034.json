However, when customer expectation is not fulfilled, customer feel disappointed complaint Customer complaints are something usual since \"Mistakes are unavoidable feature of all human endeavor and thus also of service delivery\" (Johnston, 2001). With the increasing number of restaurant in Surabaya and the increase of social media usage, the author is compelled to research on how customer of restaurant industry in Surabaya behave when they face service failure, especially media as a channel.
