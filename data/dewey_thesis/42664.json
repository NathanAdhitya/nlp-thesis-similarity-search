  "title": "Dimas’ expression of his identity as an Indonesian inleila s. chudori’s novel, Pulang",
  "abstract": "In this study, I observe the way the character in Leila S. Chudori’s novel, Pulang, preserves his identity in a foreign country. With the assumption that the main character of Pulang, Dimas, can preserve his identity in foreign country by implementing Indonesian symbols, I would like to analyze how he expresses the symbols in his life. In analyzing the novel, I use the theory of social symbols by George H. Mead. In gathering the materials, I read the novel chapter by chapter in order to get Dimas’ background since the point of view in this novel is done by different characters. In the analysis, I find that Dimas uses symbols as Indonesians to preserve his identity. By doing so, he gets the acknowledgement by the Indonesian community as a part of its member even though he lives in different nation. This shows Dimas perceives his identity because he is aware that he is part of Indonesian community. As a result, Dimas can preserve his identity as an Indonesian even though he lives far away from Indonesia.",
