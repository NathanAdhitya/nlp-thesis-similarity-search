  "title": "Beauty standard construction and its influence on consumerism in Indonesiaâ€™s Next Top Model",
  "abstract": "This thesis aims to analyze the beauty standards determined by the judges in the talent show, Indonesia's Next Top Model (INTM), as well as the influence of a culture that promotes consumerism. I analyzed the comments given by the judges to the contestants where there is also a patriarchal element that influences and shapes the mindset of the beauty standard itself. The analysis will be divided into two sub-chapters. The first part of my analysis talks about how beauty standards are formed in the Indonesia's Next Top Model event, where contestants must receive comments to become women or models that are deemed worthy. The second sub-chapter will analyze how the culture of consumerism influences this show. The beauty standards that are included with the beauty products being promoted will certainly have an effect on the consumptive society, so that they are interested in buying the products being broadcast because they feel that if you want to be beautiful like INTM models, you have to use these products, one of which is Ellips (hair vitamins). The findings show that television broadcasts cannot be separated from promoting something even though it is covertly.",
