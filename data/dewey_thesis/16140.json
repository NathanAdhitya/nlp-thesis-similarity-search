  "title": "A Study of arguments in Hendri Ibsen's a dolll's house",
  "abstract": "The play A Doll's House has two major characters: Nora and Helmer and it contains lots of arguments. This fact tempts the writer ox\" this thesis to know more about the arguments. Therefore, this study is aimed to describe kinds of argument devices, outcomes, and character change. The kinds of the devices are divided into two, that is, confrontational devices consisting of order, challenge, denial, accusation, complaint, self-defense, and so forth and non-confrontational devices consisting of statement, giving reason, suggestion, admitting, request, et cetera based on Garcia's (1989) and Austin's theory as cited in Schriffin (1994). Then the writer analysed the kinds of argument outcomes based on Vuchinich's termination format (1990) which divides basic conflict termination format into five categories, submission, compromise, withdrawal, stand off, and dominant third party intervention. After that, the writer examined the character change of Nora that was reflected through the kinds of argument devices and outcomes. The writer found that Nora's arguments in the first two acts, did not show her character's change; however, in the last act, through her arguments, she performed her significant character's change which used to be immature, spoilt to be a mature, a thinking woman.",
