  "title": "Sandyakala: a novel about a Chinese Indonesian woman's trauma, identity disruption and recovery",
  "abstract": "This creative work is designed to explore the triggers of trauma, how trauma disrupts one’s social identity and how one can recover from the trauma. The elaboration is provided in the form of a novel that utilizes the classic Social Identity Theory by Tajfel and Turner (1979), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) theory by Boyle (2017), and feminism approach. A structured written interview was conducted in order to obtain primary data, and then integrated into the story. The story focuses on Meiliana, a young Chinese Indonesian woman who is trapped in a vulnerable position during Soeharto’s regime. In her journey to heal herself from the past trauma caused by domestic violence, she encounters microaggressions, systemic discrimination and rape during the May 1998 tragedy which make her suffer from PTSD. As her self-concept and social identity are disrupted, she categorizes herself a “victim”. By being involved in activism, she slowly regains control over herself and her identity changes to “survivor”. The story shows that racial and gender-based violence can be the major causes of trauma, hence it leads to identity disruption where the victim feels powerless. It is also described that the trauma recovery process is never linear.",
