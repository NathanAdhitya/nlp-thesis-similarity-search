  "title": "Sludge application for dike cores",
  "abstract": "The sludge is enclosed by geotextile in the shape of a tube, the so called Geotube?. This is an idea that came up from the problem caused by water level rising and dredging. As a result of this, enormous amounts of dredge sludge needs to be provided a storage place somewhere. In the normal procedure before the dredge sludge had to be stored for a long time on big area?s, and then they where supposed to be cleaned. This whole procedure is not very ideal. With the Geotube? it should be easier to store the dredge sludge, it can be pumped into it on the same location and in the same time as where there will be dredged. It should save time and money is the expectation. In this thesis the research was divided in two main parts, on the first part was the execution of geotechnical testing procedures to determine the parameters and particular behaviour of the soil. On the second parts is the execution of the design phase of the dike, in this part we made a design for the dike construction which is tested on its safety on macrostability ( sliding slopes ).",
