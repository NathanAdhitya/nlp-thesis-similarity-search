  "title": "A Character study of Boris Pasternak's \"Doctor Zhivago\"",
  "abstract": "To study the characters in a novel is important, because by studying the characters we can learn more about people, about human beings . From a characters study we can obtain some knowledge about human nature . A characters study will help us understand ourselves and other people , so that we can have better self - realization and we can accep to theirs as they are. From the study of the characters of \"Doctor Zhivago\" we learn that human beings have strengths and weaknesses . Human beings have limited strength , and most of the times they have difficulties in mastering themselves and in making the best decisions . This human quality is portrayed in the characters of Zhivago and Lara, whose incapability of controlling their emotions has brought suffering both to themselves and to others . Inspite of their weaknesses they also posses some strengths just like other people . In the character of Komarovsky we can learn that intelligence used to feed selfishness is very harmful .",
