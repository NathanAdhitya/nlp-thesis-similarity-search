This paper is descriptive. The writer collected the data by observing the cashier's activities and interviewing the Finance and Accounting Department personnel. In this paper, the writer describes the Cash-receiving System of PT \"X.\" Then, the writer analyzes the way the organization receives the money and controls its assets. The writer limits the analysis to the procedures of the Cash-receipt generated from the Laboratories of Civil Engineering. Having analyzed the system, the writer comes to conclusions and gives suggestions to improve the system.",
