  "title": "The construction of Chinese Indonesians in Ngenest film",
  "abstract": "The thesis focuses on how Chinese Indonesians are constructed in Ngenest and why they are constructed that way. Chinese Indonesians become a scapegoat and considered as a wrong ethnic group since they are the minority. The ethnic construction and stereotype theory help me analyze the construction of Chinese Indonesians in Ngenest, and the reasons they are constructed that way. I would explain the Chinese Indonesian major and minor characters in Ngenest. How Chinese Indonesian characters in Ngenest interact with society reveal the Chinese Indonesian ethnic construction and the reasons for such a development. In conclusion, Chinese Indonesians are not accepted as oneâ€™s own in their land because of their construction as perpetual foreigners and being rich by exploiting non-Chinese Indonesians. They are constructed as such because of the stereotype, which results in prejudice in society. Since the Chinese Indonesians are the minority, they do not have the power to take control of society. They become a scapegoat and target of non-Chinese Indonesians.",
