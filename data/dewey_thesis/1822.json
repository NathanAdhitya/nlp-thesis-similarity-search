  "abstract": "This thesis concerns with the process of development in Josephine March?s character traits in Louisa May Alcott?s Little women. In the beginning of the story, Jo?s character traits are shown by her early ways in solving her problems. Through some events and conflicts, Jo finally develops. Therefore, I am curious to find out the process of Jo?s development and her changing ways in handling her problems. As I use literary approach, I apply the theories of characterization and conflict. In my analysis, I observe both external and internal conflicts which make Jo?s character traits develop. I analyze Jo?s process of development due to her relationship with her sisters in her family. I also analyze Jo?s character changes in her relationship with others, especially with her friend Laurie. As a conclusion, I find out the conflicts lead Jo to her character development. Besides, Jo?s falling in love with Prof. Bhaer, and her sisters? happy marriages also make Jo become a wiser and better person.",
