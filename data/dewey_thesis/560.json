  "abstract": "Standard for development of BQ's (Bill of Quantity) plays a very crucial role in the Construction Industry, especially when there is a need to make comparisons among BQ items across projects, preliminary cost estimates of particular buildings, resource consumption (material as well as labor), etc. Unfortunately such standard with a Nation Wide Scope does not exist in the Indonesian Construction Industry. A Standard for the generation of BQ in construction projects, has been developed by comparing and making adjustments to standard available in other countries such as the British Standard (CESMM) and Singaporean Standard These adjustments are necessary before it can be smoothly adapted by the Construction Industry in Indonesia. This set of standards was developed with the thought that computers and electronic files will be used to generate and store the BQ. This reseach also include the development of a Database to accommodate this standard and the resulting BQ. Considering the wide range of coverage, flexibility, and user friendliness inherent in this standard, it is quite reasonable to came to the conclusion that this standard can be easily adapted by Construction Practises in Indonesia and will therefore help to increase efficiency in the Indonesian Construction Industry on macro scale.",
