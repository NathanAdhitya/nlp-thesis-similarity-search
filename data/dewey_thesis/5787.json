  "title": "The Study on Annie's desire in Eugene O'neill's The Ile",
  "abstract": "Annie has difficulty to reveal her true desire. Therefore, I want to know why experiencing exciting sea life is not Annie?s true desire and why having companionship is Annie?s true desire. I use literary approach, namely conflict, characterization and symbolism in order to help me to analyze the reason of Annie?s untrue and true desire. I also want to use Friedan?s feminine mystique and Lips? theory of loneliness. I find out that I conclude that there are two reasons of experiencing sea life as Annie?s untrue desire. The first reason is Annie?s unhappiness while she is experiencing exciting sea life. Annie?s unhappiness is caused by her discomfort on physical and social environment. The second reason is my consideration on Annie?s failure in understanding her true desire. Moreover, I also found out that there is one reason of having experiencing sea life as Annie?s true desire. The reason is Annie?s unhappy life. Annie?s unhappy life is caused by her loneliness which demands a companionship. Another cause of Annie?s unhappy life is her inability to fulfill her desire for experiencing sea life.",
