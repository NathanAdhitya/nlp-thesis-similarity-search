  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of the effects of environment to the main character, Gregor Melekhov, in Mikhail Sholokov's And Quiet Flows The Don. Since Gregor lives in two different conditions of environment, the thesis writer is curious to know how Gregor Melekhov leads his life before the wars and what happens to him during the wars condition. From the discussion it is revealed that someone's different environment effect someone's character traits and make someone's react differently to each of it. Before the wars, Gregor lives in a comfortable life together with his family. Yet, this setting does not make him become a good person, he is passive, irresponsible, weak, and selfish. However, in the different environment, that is during the wars which can be considered bad since there is a lot of suffering and violence, Gregor reacts differently, Gregor becomes a brave, responsible, thoughtful, and unselfish person. Finally the thesis writer can conclude that settings influence much on Gregor Melekhov's character traits and the setting in the wars is the most influential setting that changes Gregor's character. The setting or environment can lead someone to be a good and mature person as Gregor. This also proves the power of setting which can make someone's character not stick on one particular type.",
