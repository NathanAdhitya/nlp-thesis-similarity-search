  "title": "Aslan's illocutionary acts used in the film The Chronicles of Narnia",
  "abstract": "Language is a media to communicate with each other. In communication, there are many meanings being interpreted. Those interpretations can be investigated by Speech Acts theory. Because of various different interpretations, the writer investigates the aspects of illocutionary act. Consequently, in order to understand the illocutionary act, the writer investigates felicity conditions based on the context. As a media, he uses the film The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe because in this film, Aslan as the main protagonist produces utterances which contain different illocutionary acts to different people with different purpose which can be analyzed based on the felicity conditions and figure of speech. As theories, he uses the concept of symbol and allusion, Searle?s and Austin?s speech acts theory, and Hurford and Heasley?s felicity conditions. In analyzing the film, he uses Internet website to search the script. The data are divided into five scenes that describe the scene based on context. He identifies Aslan?s illocutionary act utterances then put the results into a table in the Appendix. As a result, in this film, Aslan uses different illocutionary act to different people (the Witch and the children/Narnians with different purposes, even though he uses same illocutionary act (like ordering). Finally, the felicity conditions and context signify illocutionary act importantly to avoid miscommunication.",
