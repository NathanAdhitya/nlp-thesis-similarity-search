  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of the idea of sin and salvation as revealed through the main characters in Graham Greene's Brighton Rock.The thesis writer is curious to know how the three main characters, Pinkie, Ida, and Rose, reflect-Graham Greene's remarkable idea about sin and salvation. From the discussion, it is revealed that what are seen from the three main characters'appearances are not the same as the inside. Pinkie is sinful according to the Roman Catholic doctrine, yet he has some human feeling characters inside. Eventhough Ida looks good from the outside, inside she is sinful according to the Roman Catholic doctrine. Rose is different from both of them, she is a good Catholic girl and eventhough she looks weak from the outside, inside she is strong. Reacting differently towards the mercy of God in their lives, two of the three main characters finally can get their salvation, while the other character cannot. The thesis writer can conclude that Greene's idea about sin and salvation is remarkable. As a Catholic, he acknowledges that one who lives in accordance with the church teachings will get his/her salvation.Then,one who looks good outside, but rejects God in his/her heart, will not get salvation. Final - ly, one who appears evil and wicked, but is willing to repent, will get salvation.",
