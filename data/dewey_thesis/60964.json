  "title": "Obsession: a screenplay on obsessive compulsive disorders impact on relationships",
  "abstract": "This creative work explores Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and its profound impact on relationships, challenging common misconceptions and highlighting its prevalence and complexity. OCD is characterized by intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors that significantly affect individuals' well-being and interpersonal dynamics. Despite its widespread nature, OCD often faces trivialization, portrayed merely as quirks rather than recognized as a debilitating mental illness. Through the narrative of Ethan and Ophelia, this screenplay aims to raise awareness about OCD, particularly its effects on relationships. Ethan's struggle with OCD underscores the challenges faced by individuals and their loved ones, emphasizing the importance of understanding mental health issues and seeking evidence-based treatments like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT, grounded in scientific research, focuses on modifying maladaptive thinking and behavior patterns through techniques such as recognizing cognitive distortions, addressing behavioral patterns, and developing coping skills. By blending elements of romance and suspense, this work seeks to emotionally engage the audience and foster a compassionate and inclusive approach to mental health.",
