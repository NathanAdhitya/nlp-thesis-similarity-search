  "title": "A Study of the main characters' alienation in J.D. Salinger's Nine Stories",
  "abstract": "Nine Stories is Jerome David Salinger's collection of short stories pertaining to alienation. This thesis refers to the causes and the effects of alienation on the main characters in those nine stories. To find out the causes and the results of the alienation of the main characters, the thesis writer analyzes the central characters' attitudes and their problems which are considered as the causes of the alienation. Then, she discusses what happens to them as a result of their isolated condition. The causes of the main characters' alienation are various: war, abnormal behavior, dissapointment, betrayal, the death of the parents, and the feeling of being ignored. These experiences have different effects on the main characters. Those who can get help at handling their problems can survive and come out from the alienated world but those who cannot get help from others will end in loneliness, frustration, death, and self alienation. The thesis writer sees alienation as a means of the development of the human personality for those who are successfull in overcoming it. But those who fail to overcome it, will not be able to face reality and continue to be kept out from their society. In some cases, the result is death.",
