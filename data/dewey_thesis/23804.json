  "abstract": "One of the best attested facts about child language development is the appearance of systematic relationships between adult speech sounds and the corresponding child speech sound during the period of greatest phonological development. This relationship is regarded as instances of phonological process. The phonological process phenomenon has universal significance in that some processes are extremely common across many languages and many children, while others are more likely in particular children or are favoured by particular children. (Macken, 1981). This thesis presents further evidence o f phonological process which involves substitution, assimilation, and syllable structure process. The data of an Indonesian child aged two years old is analyzed ba.sed on each process. The result confirms the above statement, revealing that phonological process also occurs in the subject's speech.",
