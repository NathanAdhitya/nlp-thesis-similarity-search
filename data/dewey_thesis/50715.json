  "abstract": "Love is a topic that often adapted into a story. Relatability is the reason why. However, the love that is usually depicted is love between lovers. Short animated film Bergfrue, while still telling a story about love, shows love that is not usually adapted: siblingâ€™s love. Bergfrue tells a story about two sisters going on a journey of dreams before death. This thesis will discuss the making of Bergfrue from beginning to end, from pre-production, production, to post-production. Pre-production includes making the story concept, film concept, and storyboard. Production includes pre-visualization, modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, lighting, and rendering. Post-production includes FX, compositing, editing, and sound design.",
