  "title": "A Study on Blanche Dubois's personality disorder as seen in tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study about the symptoms of Blanche Dubois?s personality disorder in Tennessee Williams?s A Streetcar Named Desire. The purpose of writing this thesis is to show the symptoms of Blanche?s personality disorder. To analyze Blanche Dubois as the main character in this play, I use literary approach namely characterization and conflict and also psychological concepts of schizophrenia. I use conflict as the main theory to find out problems and conflicts between Blanche Dubois and Stanley Kowalski and her sister, Stella Kowalski, which contribute to the development of the symptoms. The reason I use the psychological concept of schizophrenia is to show that the main character?s psychological disorder is indeed schizophrenia. Thus, the symptoms of Blanche Dubois? personality disorder are disturbances of perception, delusions and illusions, and withdrawal from reality. From the analysis, it can be concluded that Blanche Dubois as the main character has become insane because of bad treatments that she has from her surrounding and also because of situations that she has in her family.",
