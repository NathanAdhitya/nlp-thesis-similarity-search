  "abstract": "Private Lives is the story of misadventures caused by an exchange of husbands and wives.The spouse is Elyot and Sibyl,and the other spouse is Victor and Amanda.Elyot is honeymooning with his second wife Sibyl in France, and he discovers that his first wife Amanda is in the same hotel honeymooning with her new husband Victor. Recalling their marriage,Elyot and Amanda dicide to leave their new spouses and elope to Paris. The writer of this thesis would like to find out whether Elyot and Amanda ?s speech differ in their use of language. From the beginning to the end of the story it seems that Amanda uses many more tag questions than Elyot does,but she uses less taboo words than Elyot.In the use of politeness markers,Amanda uses more polite forms than Elyot and he tends to address others rudely but Amanda does not. The writer of this thesis uses sociolingaistic theories to show the relationship between Elyot ?s and Amanda ?s uses of different speech and their sosial factors and through the analysis we will see the different speech used between man and woman.",
