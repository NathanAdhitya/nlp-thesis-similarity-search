It is supported by Kridalaksana, Crystal, Wardhaugh, and Holmes’s theories of address terms. She observed four online shops for female teenagers and four online shops for young mothers, ten comments from each shop. She found out that three types of address terms are used to female teenagers and five types of address terms are used to young mothers. The similarities are all address terms are female type address terms; formal name did not occur; and several same address terms types occurred in both types of shops. The differences are kinship terms variation in online shops for female teenager and young mothers; intimate name and other types occurred in online shops for young mothers; and the frequency of each address term’s type.",
