  "title": "A Study on Sayuri's problems which make her eager be a successful Geisha in Arthur Golden' memoirs of Geisha",
  "abstract": "Memoirs of a Geisha is a novel created by an American modern writer named Arthur Golden. He is known to be the first American novelist who writes about Japanese geisha?s life. Memoirs of a Geisha is his first novel. That is set during the 19th century. This novel is dealing with the life of Japanese woman particularly a geisha. I am interested in taking this dominant theme about the woman?s struggle. However, in my analysis, I will only focus on Sayuri as the main character who experiences many obstacles while she is spending her life as a geisha. Sayuri?s problems become the issue that I want to discuss. I want to find the problems which make her eager to be a successful geisha. In order to analyze it, I use the literary approach, such as characterization and conflict. In addition, I also use the history of Japanese geisha as the supporting reference. In the analysis, I find out that the problems are financial, love, and oppression. Sayuri?s ways to deal with her problems has already changed her personality. She becomes obedient, mature and independent. Finally, she can fulfill her desire to be a successful geisha and solve all her problems.",
