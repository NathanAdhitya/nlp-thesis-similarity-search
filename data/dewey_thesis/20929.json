  "abstract": "BLACK LIKE ME by John Howard Griffin,and CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY by Alan Paton,are talking about the racial problems between Whites and Blacks.Since they have the same topic of discussion,the most interesting way of comparing the books are studying them through the authors techniques. The authors have their own ways of revealing their major themes that can be seen through the use of dialogues and narrative as well as through the various examples of love . Besides that,they still have their'own ways of gaining the readers sympathy and empathy.Their techniques,in this case,can b'e viewed through the choice of actual topic,the use of simple language and of points of view. However,the most amazing-technique used is the way of organising the stories.The authors use divisions, symmetrical balance and juxtaposition.Paton has beauti - fully framed his novel with the mountains.Griffin, however,writes his story in juxtaposition.Comparing these elements of techniques in both novels,the readers can acknowledge,how crucial technique of a novel.",
