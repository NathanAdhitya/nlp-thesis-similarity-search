  "abstract": "In this study, the writer analyzed phonetic errors found in the students of Speaking two at the English Department of Petra Christian University. The purpose of this study was to find out the kinds of phonetic errors produced by Speaking two students as well as to find out factors that might affect one’s pronunciation, which contains phonetic errors. The subjects of this study were the students of Speaking two at the English Department of Petra Christian University. The theories used by the writer are that of the production of English consonants (CelceMurcia et al., 2004) and Indonesian consonants (Moeliono and Dardjowidjojo, 2003). To collect the data, the writer conducted reading tests and interviews for the participants. The findings of the study showed that there were fourteen deviation patterns found from the students’ phonetic transcription. As from the interviews, the writer managed to find eleven factors that affected students’ pronunciation abilities. From this study, it could be concluded that the non-existence of the English consonants in Indonesian is the main factor of their pronunciation errors. On the other hand, the students’ attitude towards the language is crucial in determining their current pronunciation levels.",
