  "title": "The concept of excellence in Nike advertisement \"unlimited series\"",
  "abstract": "This thesis mainly deals with Barthes’s process of signification, denotation, connotation, and Knowles’s and Moon’s theory of metaphor in order to reveal the excellence concept in the branding of Nike video commercial “Unlimited Series”. Those theories being used help the writer in analyzing the excellence concept and the use of verbal and visual expressions in the video commercials, then, figuring out the excellence concept used in the video commercials. The writer analyses three video commercial of Nike under the “Unlimited Series” which are “Unlimited You”, “Unlimited Youth”, and “Unlimited Future”. This research uses qualitative content analysis by Krippendorff (2004) to describe the branding concept in a systematic way. From the analysis, the writer found out that the Nike aims to motivate and inspire its audience through the excellence concept. Furthermore, Nike defines the excellence concept as a form of success which comes in the form of ability to pass through the challenge. Nike associates that success with high endurance, confidence, and optimism as pictured in the video commercials. The verbal and visual expressions are aimed to inspire and motivate the audiences to be optimistic, have confidence, and have high endurance to achieve success.",
