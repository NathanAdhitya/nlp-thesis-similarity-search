  "title": "A multimodal analysis on Rick Singer from operation varsity blues: the college admissions scandal",
  "abstract": "Multimodality is significant in communication since it combines more than one semiotic mode to make meaning. This study analyzed the representation of Rick Singer, an entrepreneur involved in a bribery crime, as shown in a documentary called Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal. The research analyzed the oral and visual modes employed to construct Rick Singer's representation. The research aims to show that multimodality can help reveal particular character representations. This study applies multimodality theory (Kress, 2006) and semiotic modes (Chia & Chan, 2017). The data was analyzed through monologues, dialogues, and visual forms depicting people, objects, and places. This study also analyzed the interplay of the oral and visual modes. It was found that Rick Singer was represented as a successful and wealthy entrepreneur that was well known for his vast and deep connection with many higher-ups. However, he was more than just an entrepreneur or education agent; he was also a scheming and unrepentant individual. As a conclusion it can be said that multimodality makes representation comprehensive and relatively straightforward.",
