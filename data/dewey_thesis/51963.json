  "title": "The portrayal of Jesus in the film Son of God",
  "abstract": "This thesis discusses how Jesus is portrayed as a New Messiah in the film Son of God. Compared to the most popular concept about Messiah in the first century, Jewish people believed that a Messiah would come with similar characteristics like King David. They believed that he would be a strong person gathering a strong army to beat the enemy and set the people free from oppression. After that, the Messiah would proclaim the victory and establish the kingdom of Israel. Differently, Jesus came as a humble man in a poor family. During his ministry, Jesus did not gather an army, but low-profile disciples because his intention was not to build an earthly kingdom but the divine one. He served the people by performing miracles by his own authority to show that he had divine nature. At the end of his ministry, Jesus experienced suffering and death in order to save the people from eternal death because he was the true lamb offering. The last, Jesus resurrected from death proving that all of his Messianic claims were true and he had divine nature.",
