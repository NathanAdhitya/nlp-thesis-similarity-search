  "title": "Decentralized finance crime systematic review and causal analysis using graph structure",
  "abstract": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) crime has become an important problem to address in the last three years. While there is much research conducted to improve the security of the DeFi platform, not much research is conducted to study the criminal activity itself. Understanding the criminal activities will benefit us for planning and further research on DeFi platform security. In this work an analysis to study DeFi crime is conducted by systematically reviewing cases of DeFi crimes in the past three years. The review data can then be analyzed using Bayesian Network to better understand the causal relationships between variables. Subgraphs of the network can also be analyzed to find more factors that cause problems in DeFi crimes.",
