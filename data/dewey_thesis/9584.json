  "abstract": "When people live in a multilingual community, they tend to use the dominant language of the community than their mother tongue. The shift from one minority language, mother tongue, to a language of wider society is often called as language shift. The writer wants to find the occurrence of Teo Chiu language shift among the second and the third generations of the Teo Chiu Chinese family. The source of data for this research was all the utterances which were spoken by the second and the third Teo Chiu generations. The main theory used in this study was language shift theory from Holmes (1992) and the supporting theories used in this study were code choices theory from Holmes (1992), and expression theories from Kennedy (2003) and Emery (2005). After analyzing the data, the writer found out that Teo Chiu was still the dominant code for the second generation and Indonesian was the dominant code for the third generation. The writer also found that the second generation used 91.1% of Teo Chiu expressions but the third generations only used 8.8% of Teo Chiu expressions. From the findings, the writer concludes that the third generation of the Teo Chiu Chinese family experience language shift by displacing Teo Chiu, their mother tongue, with Indonesian language which is the local?s dominant language.",
