  "abstract": "Harlingen 31 is the part of the highway in the North of Netherland, which only have 1 by 2 driving lane. The failure implementation of zuiderzeespoorlijn project gives opportunities for upgrading the Harlingen N31. These projects consist of various types of work item. To fulfill the demand from the Provincie of Fiyslan to optimize project cost, section of alignment and Train Bridge choose as scope for this final thesis. To determine the optimum design for future highway construction, alternative for the section of alignment and various construction methods for the train are made. Complete observation for the possible alternative are explain including risk and cost estimation for every alternative. Multi criteria analysis is made to determine the best alternative. And as the conclusion for this phase foil with strut and build deck separately are recommended for the Provincie of Fiyslan. Base on the best possible combine alternative which made after the alternative study, detail calculation for the train bridge is accomplished.",
