  "title": "The Netherlands for FCUK: a study on clothing buying behaviour",
  "abstract": "This dissertation examines the consumer buying behaviour for apparel products in one of the largest European clothing markets, the Netherlands. To make it unique, this research takes French Connection (FCUK), a British fashion retailer, as the client for the project. A consumer?s decision to purchase a product consists of five stages: problem recognition, information search, alternative evaluation, decision, and post-purchase behaviour. It is a complex process as it differs from one person to another. And there are many factors affecting this behaviour. Questionnaires are used as the main tool to gather data about clothing buying behaviour in the Netherlands, as well as the consumers? perception towards the brand FCUK. The writer believes that understanding the factors influencing consumer buying behaviour is vital to the success of any companies in surviving the increasingly competitive business world.",
