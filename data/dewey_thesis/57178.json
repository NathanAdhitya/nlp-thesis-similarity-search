  "abstract": "A creative and innovative advertisement is required by a company to attract customers. Nowadays, advertisements are in the form of videos that can be watched on social media like YouTube. So, advertisers must utilize an attractive technique to convince viewers to buy their products, and they need to deliver the messages to the customers. To deliver the messages, advertisers employ semiotic modes such as visual mode, linguistic mode, and gestural mode. Therefore, in this thesis, I want to find the denotative and connotative meanings as expressed through the semiotic resources used and the messages delivered in the iPhone 13 Relax, it’s iPhone video advertisement. This thesis uses qualitative content analysis because the data is in the form of text and images. I use the theory of the process of signification by Chandler (2017) and the semiotic mode as supporting theories. After analyzing the semiotic resources, I find the denotative and connotative meanings in the ads which deliver messages that the iPhone 13 has three features namely water-resistance, long battery life, and durability. The message that these advertisements create is a brand myth, that is, people do not have to worry when they use iPhone 13 in an unfavorable situation.",
