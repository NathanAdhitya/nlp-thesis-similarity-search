  "title": "Address forms by husbands and wives in Javanese families",
  "abstract": "This study is done to find the use of address forms by husbands and wives in Javanese families, particularly in discovering the patterns of address that husbands and wives in daily life. The main theory that is used is address in American English by Roger Brown and Marguerite Ford, which identifies the patterns of address forms, especially the use of multiple names between extreme intimates. I also use related theory by Hildred Geertz, and related study by Supriyanto and his team. This study is a descriptive qualitative research. To collect the data, I use naturalistic interview because this study deals with people in certain cultural background as well as the norms that apply in their society. Finally, I find that the address forms that appear are kin term (KT) like mama -papa, ibu - ayah/bapak, dhik/jeng - mas, ning - cak, first name (FN), and other form that occur in particular family (O) like ndhung. Moreover, reciprocal usage of KT is the most common pattern. Furthermore, I discover that the status of husbands and wives affect the choice of address forms.",
