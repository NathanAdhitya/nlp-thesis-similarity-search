  "abstract": "One of the interesting things of watching a movie is understanding the implied meaning of the conversation based on our own imagination. However, it can mislead the implied meaning of the movie itself. Therefore, the writer is interested in finding out the right way to get the implied meaning of conversation in a movie, especially the conversation that flouted the maxims. In this research, the writer used the theory of conversational implicature and flouting of maxims by Grice (1975). In addition, the context of situation by Hymes (1964) is used to get the implied meaning more easily. Furthermore, the data is the conversations among the main characters, that is, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger in ?Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire? movie which provide many examples of responding utterances that flouted the maxims. In analyzing the data, first, the writer found the conversation that flouted the maxims based on the context and the scene. Second, the writer classified the types of the maxims. Then, the writer analyzed the implied meaning based on the context of situation. The result of the analysis shows that the context of situation gave contribution in analyzing the implied meaning.",
