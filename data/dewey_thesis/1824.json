After that, the thesis writer tries to analyze the problem of her thesis into a statement of a problem: ?how the black main character, Pecola, experiences bad treatments because of racism and her ugly appearances and what effects are found on herself?. The thesis writer wants to know the ways Pecola experiences bad treatments and the effects on her life. She also tries to discuss the causes of the bad treatments. To analyze the problem of her thesis, the writer uses some literary approach namely characterization, conflict, and concepts of racism. The thesis writer sees that the main character, Pecola, is treated badly both by the whites and the blacks who consider themselves as the whites because they have some whites? qualities namely light skin, better condition of life, and the whites? education, and good dresses or clothes where Pecola does not have all of those qualities.
