This research was done using a qualitative descriptive approach. The writer found out that in this study, Agus Sanetyo used all three types of code-switching types and three of six functions of code-switching, with the most used type was the intra-sentential and the most function used was the referential function. In conclusion, analyzing the types and functions of code-switching could bring us to understand the hidden motivations behind it.",
