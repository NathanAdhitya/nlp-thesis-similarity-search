  "title": "Converted villain: a study on gru's changing character traits in despicable me",
  "abstract": "This thesis concerns with Gru’s character development in Despicable Me. In this movie, Gru is described as a greatest super villain and the father of three daughters. I am interested in analyzing his character development because his experience with the girls and his changes affect him and others. I am curious to know how Gru’s character traits change and what causes his character development. Through the analysis, I want to analyze the process of Gru’s character development. In this research, I used the theory of the characterization and conflict. In addition, I also use the theory of personality to get a better understanding of the impact of character development. In my analysis, I find that Gru, the main character, undergoes a process that develops his character traits into better ones. As a result, Gru is well accepted by other people. Based on the findings, I conclude that differences in character traits should not be a stumbling stone for living in harmony. One thing that is very important is that people should show their understanding to others and be mindful to others’ feeling. In this way, they can have a more meaningful life.",
