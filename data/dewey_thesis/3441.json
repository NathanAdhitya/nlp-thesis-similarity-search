The focus of this novel is family relationships amongst the MacLeod. It becomes a beautiful tribute to and description of a loving marriage that is eventually torn apart by an evil war. This thesis focuses on what Elizabeth?s efforts are to maintain her relationship with Gerald. Furthermore, this thesis will attract the readers to do some other research based on the same author. Moreover, this thesis gives an understanding for the reader to maintain their relationship. This thesis discusses only on the study of Elizabeth?s efforts to maintain her inter-cultural relationship. To answer the question, the use of literary approach, in example the theory of characterization and conflict will be helpful in explaining Elizabeth?s character. The background knowledge of inter-cultural relationship will also give contribution in finding Elizabeth?s problems in her life. However, she can overcome all of those problems by having a great trust toward her husband. She is a tough woman and willing to sacrifice for her husband?s happiness. Finally, the analysis ends with the conclusion that racial problems should not be problems in a marriage as long as the two persons love each other.",
