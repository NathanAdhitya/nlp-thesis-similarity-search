  "title": "A Study of the main character's search for the meaning of life in Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea",
  "abstract": "This thesis covers the study of the condition of modern man based on Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialism. Man should find his own existence since his existence in the world is doubtful. Considering this. Sartre wants to portray this condition through his main character, Antoine Roquentin, in his novel Nausea. The writer is curious to know how Antoine Roquentin's search for his meaning of life reflects Sartre's idea of existentialism. The problem that happens to Antoine Roquentin is the problem of the modern man who is searching for the meaning of his life. Through Antoine Roquentin, the writer wants to show that man who lives in the 20th century has a problem with his existence, loneliness and nothingness. This problem disturbs Antoine that he undergoes a long journey searching for the meaning of his life. In his search, he finally finds the meaning of his life, that is his existence.",
