  "title": "Increasing the brand awareness of Artotel Surabaya using a promotional video",
  "abstract": "ARTOTEL Surabaya is a three-star hotel. The location of ARTOTEL Surabaya is at Jalan Dr. Soetomo, 79-81, Tegalsari, Surabaya. The problem related to Business Communication that I found at ARTOTEL Surabaya is poor brand awareness compared to the other hotels which has a good brand awareness such as Pop Hotel, Cleo Business Hotel, and Oval Hotel. Because of this problem, the focus is on increasing the brand through the hidden uniqueness of ARTOTEL Surabaya. In this way, the promotional video will be the solution. The contents of ARTOTEL Surabayaâ€™s promotional video are three USP and ending. The USP is about the location, the unique rooms, and the foods. There are some theories about brand awareness, branding, promotion, and promotional video. This promotional video can be a new innovation to promote the hotel since ARTOTEL Surabaya does not have a promotional video before. As a result, ARTOTEL Surabaya will have a good brand awareness as a hotel with a good hospitality and a touch of art. The hotel itself will gain some benefits. For instance, they will get the promotional video to be their additional sales tool, their brand awareness will be increased, and people will recognize the uniqueness of ARTOTEL Surabaya.",
