  "abstract": "This thesis is an analysis of optimism in Rob Roy. It deals with the life of the main character, Frank Osbaldistone, in facing his problems. In the analysis, I want to know how the internal and the external factors maintain Frank's optimism and finally makes his father's opinion toward him change so that his father takes him as the Lord of Osbaldistone Hall. In the analysis, I use the theory of characterization to reveal the main character's optimism. I also use the definition of optimism itself to help me in describing the main character's optimism. Through the analysis, I find out that Frank's optimism is maintained by his character traits. Frank has a strong will that makes him not easy to give up in facing any difficulty. He has the courage and self-confidence that make him not afraid of anything. His love and responsibility also have a great influence in maintaining his optimism. Besides that, there are other factors that have the influence in maintaining his optimism, they are Diana and Rob Roy. Through these internal and external factors, Frank lives in a hopeful life and has confident outlook. He has been in a long journey to achieve his goal, to reclaim his father's credit, and the journey has proved him to be an optimistic person.",
