  "title": "The Representation of cultural content in Global Elementary coursebook",
  "abstract": "This study is done to find out the types of cultural content source found in the reading and listening texts presented in Global elementary coursebook published by Macmillan Education in 2010 and the similarities and differences of the types of cultural content source found in those texts being evaluated. This study is a qualitative research. The findings of this study show that in Global elementary coursebook the reading texts met 54.9% of global culture, 35.3% of target culture, and 9.8% of local culture. The listening texts met 72.5% of global culture, 25% of target culture, and 2.5% of local culture. The global culture is presented more in the coursebook and the local culture gets less attention. The coursebook presents significant gap of global and target culture in listening texts as there were probably some limitations in providing various real-life speakers from different parts of the world. Another plausible reason was because the authors knew that listening to audio files might not be visible in many places in this world. All in all, as proposed by Matsuda (2012), a good coursebook is the one that has multiple sources of cultural content; and Global elementary coursebook fulfills this criterion as it has three types of cultural content source.",
