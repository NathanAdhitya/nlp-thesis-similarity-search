  "abstract": "This study observes the speech style of a Buddhism priest at a Buddhism vihara in Surabaya. It deals with the cohesive devices used by the priest in giving a lecture. Speech style is unique since everyone used it different style in everyday communication. This analyst based on Halliday and Hasan's Type of Cohesion - Grammatical Cohesion and Lexical Cohesion. The grammatical cohesion consists of Reference, Substitution, Conjunction and Ellipsis; while in lexical cohesion there are Reiteration and Collocation. The focus of this study is cohesive devices since the function of cohesive devices is to relate sentences (meaning unit) which occurs in priest speech. Through the analysis the writer found out that the reference type occurs mostly, followed by the reiteration type, ellipsis type, collocation type and the last are substitution type and conjunction type. The writer found out in term of different types of cohesion, the priest uses relatedness of reference type more than relatedness of form and semantic connection. The writer concludes that the priest's speech is considered unique since in his lecture he connects each sentence to each adjacent sentence spontaneously without any preparation.",
