  "title": "A Comparative study between Theodore Dreiser's an American tragedy and F. Scott Fitzgerald's this side of paradise",
  "abstract": "The novels that are going to be discussed in this thesis are Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy and F.Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise and these novels are used as the reflections of the situation in America around the nineteen twenty. In the novels,Dreiser and Fitzgerald convey the same topic that is about their characters'dreams to gain success and how they are finally trapped by their own dream. But in conveying their subjects, the au - thors use different approaches -Dreiser conveys his topic based on Naturalism point of view while Fitzge - rald from Romanticism point of view.As a naturalist, Dreiser tends to emphasize the lower and coarser form of life and portraying man as the victim of forces beyond his full understanding.And Fitzgerald, a romantic,describes his character as a person who cannot face reality, therefore he prefers to live in the dream world where his imagination holds control. From psychological point of view, Dreiser's and Fitzgerald's characters'dream of success are greatly influenced by two factors, that are Hedonism or the desire to enjoy good time, and the other is the role of childhood in shaping the characters'concepts about success. By analizing these two novels, the readers can understand more about the situation and condition of the twenties and realize that the problems of that generation are still relevant to the society nowadays.",
