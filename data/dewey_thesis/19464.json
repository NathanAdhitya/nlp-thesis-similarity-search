  "abstract": "This study is sociolinguistic study of speech styles used by the male and female pastor when they are delivering the sermon. Here, I want to find the types of speech styles which are mostly used by the male and female pastors in delivering their sermons. This research is based on the Joos ? (1976) theory; there are four types of speech styles used by the male and female pastors, which are frozen, formal, consultative and casual styles. Furthermore, I also used Kridalaksana ?s theory of standard Indonesian as the supporting theory. Concerning the analysis, I analyzed the data and put them into categories according to the theory above. At the end of the analysis, I found out that the male pastor mostly used casual style while the female pastor mostly used consultative style in delivering the sermon. Finally, I give some interpretations on the findings. B ased on Joos ?speech styles,the male and female pastors used different speech styles in delivering the sermons. Here, the male pastors mostly used casual style and the female pastor mostly used consultative style when they delivered the sermon.",
