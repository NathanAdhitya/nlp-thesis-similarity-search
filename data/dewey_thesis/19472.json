  "abstract": "This research is a sociolinguistic study focusing on the strategies of gratitude expression in English produced by the native speakers of English (American) and the nonnative speakers of English (Chinese-Indonesian) in Surabaya. This research also seeks to understand the differences of the strategies used by the respondents. The respondents consist of five Americans and five Chinese - Indonesians. The researcher collected the data herself from the role plays which were adopted from Eisestein and Bodman (1983), Cheng (2005), and the researcher?s in order to cover more various settings and the personal data from the respondents. The researcher uses Haverkate?s theory (1984, cited in Aijmer, 1996, p.37) on the eight strategies of gratitude expression as the main theory for analyzing the data. The researcher uses the descriptive quantitative approach and the findings will be shown on the table. The finding indicates that both native speakers of English (American) and the nonnative speakers of English (Chinese-Indonesian) mostly used explicit strategy in expressing gratitude. The researcher found that ethnicity is not only the factor that affects people in expressing gratitude as there are some other potential factors such as, language exposure and attitudes toward both cultures.",
