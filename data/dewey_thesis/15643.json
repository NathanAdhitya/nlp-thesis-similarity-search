  "abstract": "In this thesis, the writer tries to analyze the love of the two main male characters, Arthur Burdon and Oliver Haddo towards the main female character, Margaret Dauncey in Maugham's The Magician. She would like to prove which love of the two characters is truthful towards Margaret. The writer chooses \"love\" because love is universal and every human being experiences it. The writer uses J.iterary approach, characterization and conflict, and she also uses psychological theory and theory of love for support. By doing library research and close reading the novel, the writer is able to analyze the novel. In the analysis, the writer wants to show the rivalry of Arthur and Haddo through external conflict. Their conflict is emerged from their personality differences which are shown through characterization. The writer finds that character traits influence the love of the characters. From here, the love of the characters is proved. The writer in the end discovers that Arthur's love towards Margaret is true, whether Haddo's love towards her is a fake.",
