  "title": "Apple’s construction of its brand as cultural capital in apps we can’t live without commercial",
  "abstract": "Commercial is an advertising strategy to promote a product or service effectively. It is effective because it is transmitted through mass media, such as radio, television and internet. It is also attractive because it touches the audience’s emotion through its music, cinematography, and storytelling. However, commercial has meaning behind every aspects mentioned above. This meaning represents the brand as symbols which distinct itself from other brand and also distinct its users to other brand users. I analyze Apps We Can’t Live Without (2014) commercial as the text to show Apple encodes meaning and transmit it to the society. Using film language and Bourdieu’s cultural capital theory, the findings show that the symbols from the commercial bring into a conclusion that Apple as a brand is a symbolic capital, specifically cultural capital. This cultural capital work only work in two fields of community set by the commercial producers which are the Apple and gadget communities. Therefore, the people who has the brand is considered to have higher position in its field. This message is unconsciously transmitted to the audience and brings the impression that Apple as a brand is a cultural capital that grants its users higher social status.",
