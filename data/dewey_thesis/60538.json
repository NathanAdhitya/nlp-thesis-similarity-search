  "title": "Tantri’s anxieties and her defense mechanisms in Sekala Niskala (2018)",
  "abstract": "This thesis discusses the anxieties and defense mechanisms present in the protagonist of Indonesian indie film Sekala Niskala (2018). This pivotal film of Kamila Andini carries rich cultural contexts and intimacy. It tells the story of Tantri, a Balinese girl, going through anxiety as she deals with her twin brother Tantra slowly dying. In this study, I am going to investigate Tantri’s anxieties and her ego’s defense mechanisms according to Sigmund Freud’s anxiety theory as well as his and Anna Freud’s defense mechanism theory. I found that Tantri displays reality, neurotic, and moral anxiety. Her reality anxiety of her brother’s deteriorating health extends to her neurotic anxiety that causes avoidance of an unthreatening space and sleeping issues, and moral anxiety that stems from her guilt for being healthy and desiring playtime with Tantra. As responses, Tantri’s ego applies the defense mechanisms of repression and sublimation. Tantri’s repression is manifested in a pretense of reality as well as dreams that reveal the fears and desires in her unconscious; her sublimation is expressed in the form of dance. The results of this study show that anxiety and its defense mechanisms are universal to different stages of life and all social backgrounds.",
