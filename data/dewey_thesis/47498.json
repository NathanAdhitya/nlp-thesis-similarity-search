  "title": "Promoting Luminor Hotel Pahlawan, Sidoarjo to its target market using a marketing booklet",
  "abstract": "In the midst of fierce competition in the hospitality business, effective promotion is needed for hotels to promote their product to its target market. This is a creative thesis report on a problem that Luminor Hotel Pahlawan, Sidoarjo, has. The three-star hotel located in Sidoarjo is believed to have ineffective marketing tools. Their prospects tend to ask for further information such as pictures and a detailed description of the facilities. Flyers that the salespeople usually give to the prospects are less informative. Thus, to introduce the product to the representatives of the prospects, a marketing booklet is needed. A marketing booklet with more space to deliver information can help the salespeople answer customers’ needs. To persuade the readers, Luminor Hotel Pahlawan, Sidoarjo’s Unique Strength Points (USP), will emphasize the marketing booklet contents. Thus, this marketing booklet will help introduce Luminor Hotel Pahlawan, Sidoarjo, to its prospects.",
