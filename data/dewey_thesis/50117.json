  "abstract": "I did my internship in Petra Language Center. The services of PLC are English Language Course, Mandarin Language Course, Japanese Language Course, French Language Course, and Dutch Language Course. Each of PLCâ€™s services will contain the description and USP. For English Language Course, it has other courses for children, teenagers, and adults that will be explained in Creative Thesis. The target market is children, teenagers, and general adults who want to enhance their foreign language skill. The competitors of PLC are Ubaya Language Center and Unesa Language Center. The main problem of PLC is that the customers do not know where to go to get the information. The solution to this problem is to make a website. There will be four pages on the website such as Home Page, About Page, Products and Services Page, and Contact Us Page. Website is a right tool for PLC because it is accessible and it provides the specific information about courses in PLC. Moreover, by having a website, PLC can promote its products to the customers externally through the internet. The benefits of PLC website are to increase sales and profit, to expand its market, and to build the relationship with the customers.",
