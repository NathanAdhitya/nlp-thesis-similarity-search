  "title": "Emily Dickinson's understanding of God through her dual attitudes towards him",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of Emily Dickinson's religious poems.The writer finds them interesting to study because they present Emily Dickinson's struggles and efforts to understand God's way in dealing with her sufferings.Through her poems,Dickinson addresses God as loving as well as cruel.In this study,the writer takes Emily Dickinson's eight poems which bear the poet's dual attitudes towards God.In analyzing the poems,the writer uses the literary devices;tone, allusion,and paradox. While talking about the highly personal matters as to questioning God's way in dealing with her sufferings,Dickinson finally claims God's active interference for the solution of her dual attitudes towards Him.Therefore, through this study,the writer would show how Dickinson's dual attitudes towards God finally leads Dickinson to find her own solution to comprehend God.Her poems assist her to enrich and improve her spiritual life.",
