  "abstract": "This thesis stresses on the study of the universe of discourse of the utterances used in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. The writer is curious to know what strategies are being used, which strategy is used mostly, and why that particular strategy is used mostly.The data are utterances taken from 3 chapters in the novel Alice in Wonderland which are then grouped into fragments to find the topics. Then from each topic, the dialogues are analysed: whether they are in the same universe of discourse or not. After that the writer analyses the strategies used in those three chapters. It is found out later that even though Alice and the creatures are from different worlds, they can still understand each other. The strategy of shared domains and coreference is used mostly to get the message across. It shows that what has been mentioned before (as shared information) serves as prior background knowledge in interactivity with other people. People from different places can still communicate well. The differences and ignorance can be bridged by the strategies used as well as the schemata. Hopefully, this thesis could be a useful contribution for the students of linguistics, especially those at Petra Christian University, who are involved in the study of universe of discourse.",
