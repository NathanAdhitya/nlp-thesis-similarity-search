  "abstract": "This thesis is talking about the problem of communication resulted from Tobias' family in Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance. In this study, the thesis writer wants to show the problem of communication and what causes of the problem of communication in Tobias' family. The problems between husband and wife inside the house lead to their conflict. Agnes expects Tobias to be wise and balanced in order to maintain the relationship in the family and to solve problems between his best friends, Harry and Edna. The Tobias' family consists of Agnes, his wife; Julia, his daughter and Claire, his sister in law. However, each of them lacks communication with Tobias. It needs to be solved by the head of family, notably Tobias. Besides that, Tobias is facing a problem between the unexpected coming of his best friends, Harry and Edna. Therefore, this raises up new problem. In fact, their communication to find the way out from the problem is still influenced by their own impulse. This is what the thesis writer wants to explore through Albee's A Delicate Balance. If the smoothness of communication is disturbed, the communication will become a problem in the relationship of one with the others.",
