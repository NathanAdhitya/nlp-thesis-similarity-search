  "title": "The Differences between nen and eurocode in slab calculation",
  "abstract": "Due to the rapid development of civil engineering in Europe, there is a plan to release EUROCODE on 2010. This code will be applied to all European countries. Beside this code, each country has complementary regulations as an additional to comply with their specific region. This report is prepared mainly to compare the differences between those codes. Specifically in this thesis, the research topic is concrete slab on high rise building. Since the limitation of time, this research is only focusing on stress and strain diagram on the concrete slab. The method is by taking one of the slab panels on first story and divides it into 3 cross sections. The data used as an input is the results of TS Liggers software received from Technosoft and lay out drawings received from Theo Verburg Architecten. The designed moment occurred on each cross section of the slab is compared to the ultimate moment capacity of the concrete slab itself by MN Kappa calculation according to NEN regulation and Eurocode. The calculation is made by Mathcad version 14.",
