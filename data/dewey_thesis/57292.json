  "title": "Gita Wirjawan's use of politeness in requesting, using address terms, and responding to compliments in two Endgame podcasts",
  "abstract": "The aim of this research is to examine how Gita performed politeness in two Endgame podcasts. The writer assesses the conversation between the subject and a minister and a non-government employee. The present analysis is from two podcasts that have been uploaded on Gita’s channel. Furthermore, the writer analyzed the politeness employed in Gita’s requests, the use of address terms, and responses to compliments. This study is grounded in First-order Politeness by Watts (2003). Since First-order politeness cannot stand independently, the Indonesian (Javanese) politeness principle by Suseno (2001) and Kuntjara (2009) is also used. The research was conducted using a qualitative approach. Based on the data, Gita had a tendency to employ direct language when making requests, frequently used ‘you’ to blur their closeness, and tended to accept compliments. Gita applies several principles of politeness, such as rukun [harmony], hormat [respect], and ethok-ethok. The findings show that Gita wanted to look neutral with someone who has the same rank and tended to appear to have a lower rank when he talks with someone with a higher rank. In conclusion, differences in rank influence how people communicate.",
