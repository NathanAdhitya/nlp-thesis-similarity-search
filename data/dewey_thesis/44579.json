  "title": "Corrective feedback on sentence errors in writing 4 class",
  "abstract": "This study was done to find out the types of teacher’s corrective feedback and the errors in sentence structure that had teacher’s input on Writing 4A students’ first draft of their four assignments. To answer these two research questions, the writer used theories from Ho (2005) about errors in sentence structure and Ellis (2009) about written corrective feedback. This study was qualitative. The source of data of this study was the Writing 4A’s four students’ first draft of their four assignments. To do the research, the writer divided the students into two groups – group A and B – based on the students’ Writing 3 final score. The findings showed that the teacher used one type of corrective feedback, i.e. indirect corrective feedback to both groups of students. The results also showed that students from group B made more errors than group A did. Most of the mistakes made were fragmented sentences and happened when the students wrote effect essays, contra essays, and compound sentences. In conclusion, the teacher did not differentiate the students in giving feedback, and students from group B had more difficulties in creating compound sentences.",
