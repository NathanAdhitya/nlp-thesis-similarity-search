  "title": "What influences the employee engagement of Indonesia younger gen y employees?",
  "abstract": "Baby Boomers are facing retirement; Gen X are starting to prepare older Gen Y to be their successors; and younger Gen Y are entering the workforce. The new entrants, younger Gen Y are different from the older Gen Y, although they are of the same generational cohorts. They are at different life stages where the former are most likely new jobbers, while the latter are those who already more stable in their career, hence they would have different goals and priorities. It is important to research on the employee engagement of Indonesian younger Gen Y so that Indonesian companies can leverage their performance. This study is done to know whether the following factors: working environment, leadership, team and co:' worker relationship, training and career development, compensation, organizational policies, and workplace wellbeing simultaneously and individually impact the employee engagement of Indonesian younger Gen Y employees. This research uses simple random sampling by distributing questionnaires to Indonesian younger Gen Y employees. The data is analyzed using Multiple Linear Regression. The result shows that aforementioned factors are simultaneously impacting the employee engagement of Indonesian younger Gen Y employees; while only team and co-worker relationship and organizational policies are individually impacting employee engagement.",
