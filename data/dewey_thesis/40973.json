Safety stock needs to be calculated accurately to reduce the excess stock or shortage stock. Safety stock generally influenced by supplier or manufacturing lead time, service level, and standard deviation. This thesis calculates and analysis the safety stock based on forecast data and historical data. It purposes to know what the best safety stock is between forecast data and historical data. ABC/FMR classifications help to give information to the company whether parts need to have stock or not. The result shows that safety stock based on historical data is better than safety stock based on forecast data. It is because safety stock based on historical data can describe the erratic customer demand than based on forecast data. Customer demand based on forecast data has the stable demand (not in wide range comparing with historical data). Safety stock based on forecast data cannot be used because it has the low percentage of forecast accuracy. Based on ABC/FMR classification several parts are suggested to have stock because has the high frequent and several parts are suggested to non-stock.",
