  "title": "Grammatical errors and basic style problems found in the abstracts of some theses of the English department in Petra Christian University",
  "abstract": "The use of abstract is essential in some scientific works, online research, directory, seminar, and call paper. In Petra Christian University, students are obliged to write an abstract as an integral part of their theses. Because of its importance, abstract must be written using the correct grammar, punctuation, and forms. Therefore, the writer interested in doing an abstract analysis on some English Department?s theses who got grade A. In conducting the analysis, she will use Francis?s (1958) theory of word-classification, Ehrlich?s (1987) theory of word mechanism; Holman (1986) and McAdams & Yopp?s (2003) paragraph structure theory, and PCU?s (2004) guideline of standard form of abstract. As a result, the writer found that most abstract still contained errors, especially in using noun types. In addition, the writer found many errors in punctuation, mostly on the use of comma. Students also tended to make mistakes related to the standard forms of abstract, especially those concerning with writing thesis qualification. Based on the analysis result, the writer suggested that students be more careful when writing an abstract. Students must pay a great deal of attention on grammar, punctuation, and also the content of the abstract itself because even students who got grade A still made mistake.",
