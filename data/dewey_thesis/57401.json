  "title": "Powerful women in Anggy Umbaraâ€™s web series: Layangan putus",
  "abstract": "Layangan Putus is a web series adapted from a novel by Drh. Eka Nur Prasetya. In this thesis, I am analyzing this series because there is a hidden gem in these five female characters, which shows their power to fight for their rights and happiness. For that, I am interested in analyzing their power and what consequences they receive. In my analysis, I use the girl power theory based on the descriptions by Zaslow (2017), Inness (2004), and Bettis & Addams (2005) on girl power, which is independent, smart, and assertive. Therefore, I will analyze the way these five female characters exercise their power by being independent, smart, and assertive. As the consequences of exercising their power, they experience positive and negative results. For the positive, they get what they want in life such as individual freedom and for the negative they must to sacrifice important things such as their feelings and personal relationship. In conclusion, in exercising their power, they gain self-growth and self-discovery and lose their reputation and lose their trust in people.",
