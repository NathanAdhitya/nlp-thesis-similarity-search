  "abstract": "This study observes the syntactic structures in the headlines of The New York Times newspaper (paper edition). Syntactic structure is a combination of more than two lexical words, with or without function words. There are four kinds of syntactic structures, i.e. structure of modification, structure of predication, structure of complementation, and structure of coordination. The researcher analyzed the syntactic structures based on Nelson Francisâ€™s theory of syntactic structures (1958). The researcher uses qualitative approach to analyze the syntactic structures used in the headlines of The New York Times newspaper (paper edition) because the data used consisted of words, not numbers. From this study, it is found that the most dominant syntactic structure used in the headlines of The New York Times is the structure of predication. This result indicates that the use of words in headlines of The New York Times (paper edition), uses more grammatical structure whose immediate constituents are a subject and a predicate. Through this analysis the researcher expects that the result will help the readers have better understanding about syntactic structures used in the headlines of The New York Times newspaper.",
