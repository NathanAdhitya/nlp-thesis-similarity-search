  "abstract": "This thesis is the study of Written Corrective Feedback (WCF) and its effects in the students’ writing drafts. It consists of 60 students’ writing drafts as the source of data, limited to language use (LU) and vocabulary. The purposes of the study are to find out the WCF strategies used in the students’ writing drafts and the effects of teacher’s WCF analyzed from the comparison between the students’ first and final drafts. The theories applied are the WCF strategies by Ellis (2009a); the effects of written feedback to students by Hyland (2003), supported by Ferris (2006). The qualitative approach was used in this study. The finding revealed that the strategies used in the class were Direct CF (430 times), and Indirect CF (329 times). The effects of teacher’s WCF were Error corrected, Incorrect change, No change, and Deleted text. Moreover, it was revealed that LU problem was more noticed by the students to be corrected. In conclusion, WCF can be considered as a feedback for the students to be more aware of their mistakes and to improve their writing.",
