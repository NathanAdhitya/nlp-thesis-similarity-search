  "abstract": "This study aimed to find the types of figurative language in the video advertising of two games, Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail. The writer used Harris (2018) theory of figurative language to analyze the utterances in the videos. Harris (2018) categorize figurative language into 11 types, namely, simile, analogy, metaphor, catachresis, metonymy, synecdoche, personification, allusion, eponym, apostrophe, and transferred epithet. The writer used qualitative research method to collect and analyze the data. The findings showed that out of 11 types, only simile, analogy, metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, personification, and allusion can be found in Genshin Impact. In contrast, Honkai: Star Rail only used simile, analogy, metaphor, metonymy, and allusion. Both used simile, analogy, metaphor, metonymy, and allusion. On the contrary, catachresis, eponym, apostrophe, and transferred epithet are not used. There are differences between the gamesâ€™ videos, namely, the use of synecdoche, personification, and combination of metaphor and synecdoche in Genshin Impact. This does not occur in Honkai: Star Rail. To conclude, the writer found several types of figurative language in the Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail. On the other hand, further research on similar subjects with broader limitations is also recommended.",
