  "title": "A Study on the tragic hero of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus",
  "abstract": "Titus Andronicus seems to be like other Shakespeare?s tragedies and the story is more concerned with state duties. However, as the writer sees it, Titus Andronicus is different from otherShakespeare?s tragedies. As the earliest tragedy, the uniqueness of Titus Andronicus is that it deals with inhuman attrocities, which is due to the inexperience of its author. It is about Titus Andronicus, as the main character in the play, who has to lose all his whole family and finally his own life in a miserable way, not because of the political duties, but in his capacity as a warrior and as a father. It is because of his wrong conception of honor that he has to come to his downfall and lose everything he loves.",
