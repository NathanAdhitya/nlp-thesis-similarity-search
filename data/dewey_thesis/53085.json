  "title": "Increasing the brand awareness of Samaya coffee shop to its target market using a promotional video",
  "abstract": "Samaya Coffee Shop, established in 2019, is a coffee shop in Solo City. Based on the research that I did, I found out that Samaya still lacks of brand awareness, because only a few people know about Samaya. Therefore, the best solution to increase Samaya’s brand awareness is by creating a promotional video with USP (Unique Selling Points). There are several Samaya USPs that I highlight in the video such as the unique menu, private meeting room, and board games. The video is uploaded to Instagram and also to paid promotion accounts in Solo city, so the video could be watched by more target audience. The reason why a promotional video is the right effective solution is because video is one of the tools that is often watched by the target market when they seek out and discover the product they want to buy. After uploading the video and the video watched by the target audience, they can recognize Samaya’s existence and Samaya can also show off their menu and facilities.",
