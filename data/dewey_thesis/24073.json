  "title": "A Sociolinguistic study of code-mixing among the employees at Petra Christian University",
  "abstract": "Many people use two or more languages in their daily life. Because of using two or more languages, some- times, they do code-mixing. It is interesting to the writer to study more about the code-mixing. In this study, she analyzes the kinds of code-mixing and the possible factors which influence the code-mixing. In doing the study, the writer uses the qualitative method. In this case, the writer focuses more on the de- scriptive explanation rather than on the numerical expla- nation. Besides, the writer uses a sociolinguistic ap- proach in analyzing the data. It means the writer deals with the social and language factors. The research finds that most of the employees at Petra Christian University as the participants have done a lot of code-mixing. The word form occurs much more fre- quently than the other forms, such as phrase, word redu- plication, idiom, hybrid clause, and clause. The mixing is mostly between Indonesian and Javanese rather than Indone- sian and other languages. This study also reveals that the code-mixing hap- pens because of several factors, that is social factors such as education, age, sex, and so forth, and the use of language in the daily life.",
