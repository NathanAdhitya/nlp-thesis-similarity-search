  "title": "The ideal masculinity of the male ninjas in Naruto and Naruto Shippuden anime series",
  "abstract": "Shounen has been one of the most well-known genres of anime for years. Although this kind of anime is usually targeted for younger boys, it is often consumed by audiences from all ages as it is popular. One of the examples is Naruto and its sequel, Naruto Shippuden. These series focus on telling a story which revolves on Naruto Uzumaki’s journey as a male ninja. In this study, I will focus on identifying the masculinity within the male ninjas and analyzing the motivations behind the exercise of masculinity to find the ideal masculinity. In order to complete my analysis, I will combine the masculinity theory with the Japanese’s manhood. Based on my analysis, I find that the male ninjas of these anime series show different kinds of masculinity. These differences are what actually divide them into two roles, protagonist and antagonist. The protagonists are the ones who thrive to fight for others while the antagonists fight only to benefit themselves. As a result, it is evident that the protagonists are the ones who possess the ideal masculinity as they are able to exercise their masculinity in a positive way.",
