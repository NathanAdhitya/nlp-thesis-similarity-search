  "title": "Max's anxiety and struggle in finding his position in harold pinter's the homecoming",
  "abstract": "Max is a man of seventy, a father and the oldest man among other members of the family who experiences anxiety. I emphasize my research in finding the cause why Max feels anxious and the ways he defends himself to overcome his anxiety and live in his present life. The main purpose of this study is to reveal the cause of Max?s anxiety and also, the ways Max defends himself in his present life in Harold Pinter?s The Homecoming. Moreover, Sigmund Freud?s concept of anxiety will be applied since this concept is the most suitable to find out why Max experiences anxiety and how he copes with his anxiety. Next, I have discovered that Max feels anxious since he is a failure according to the other family members? standpoints. As it happens, Max must use defense mechanism in order to keep on living in his present life. Thus, defense mechanism theory will be used as a tool to justify my analysis that Max is defending himself in finding his position in Harold Pinter?s The Homecoming. Hence, I discover that Max uses regression and projection to defend himself in front of the other family members and protect his position as the head of the family.",
