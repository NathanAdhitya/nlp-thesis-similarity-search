  "abstract": "This study observed the codas occurred in complaint letters which were published in newspaper. It was analyzed based on Labov?s narrative model by using qualitative approach. It focused on the types of codas and the relation between the codas and the problems. The data were taken from twenty complaint letters which were published in Metropolis Watch, a column for the readers to express their thought in Jawa Pos, especially those which concerned with the damaged goods. The findings show that there are four types of codas occurred in the complaint letters, namely, Request, Question, Argument, and Appeal. Besides, the findings also show that some complainers did not use any coda at all. Therefore, there are also some no-coda letters. The occurrences of the types of codas were not influenced by the problems that the complainers faced. There were no certain codas which occurred in certain problems.",
