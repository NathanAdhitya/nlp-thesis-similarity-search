  "abstract": "Through the adventures of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra wants to present the theme of Don Quixote that idealism represented by chivalry ironically fails in the modern realistic world. Through Don Quixote's and Sancho Panza ds, characters this thesis writer presents that idealism merely makes the idealist and other people suffer because Don Quixote's blindness to see the reality. He glorifies his ideology too much, treats daily events in an idealistic way and redresses the wrong without considering the effect of his work. Furthermore, the setting indicates that idealism succeeds in places which are far from the realists' influence and fails in the modern civilized places. Through the conflicts, idealism is proved to fail against the realistic society; and against the reality as Don Quixote dies not as an idealist but as a realist. This thesis is, then, concluded that idealism and reality should be put in balance in one's life. A man should accept the reality and not change it into the image of ideals. He needs his ideal to live by, to guide his life to a perfect one .",
