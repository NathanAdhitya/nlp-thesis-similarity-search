  "abstract": "This thesis is about code mixing used by the Era Bima Sakti Selaras (EBS) FM radio announcers in a program named EBS Time Trax. The aim of this thesis is to find out what kinds of code mixing which most frequently occur and what language components which are mostly mixed. The writer refers to the theory of Code and Code Mixing proposed by Wardhaugh as the main theory. While, Holmes' theory of Vernacular and Dialect she uses as the supporting theories. The writer analyzes the utterances in the transcription of four episodes of EBS Time Trax. She classifies the utterances into three groups: Indonesian English, Indonesian Vernacular, and Indonesian Dialect. She puts each code mixing group in tables and calculates the percentage of the code mixing utterances. From the analysis the writer finds that Indonesian Jakartanese dialect has the highest percentage. The language components used as the mixed code in each code mixing group are of word level and phrase level.",
