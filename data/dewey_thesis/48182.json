  "title": "Examination of organizational culture on AIS and corporate performance: evidence from manufacturing companies in Surabaya, Indonesia",
  "abstract": "This research paper aims to provide a more in-depth explanation regarding the impact of organizational culture on a company’s accounting information systems and corporate performance. This study was performed on medium to large manufacturing companies that are operating in Surabaya, Indonesia. Data collection was done by distributing questionnaires via Google Forms, an online survey tool. The analysis was performed on a total of 36 medium to large manufacturing companies. Organizational culture acted as the independent variable measured by the organizational culture indicators adopted from Denison’s Model. Accounting information systems served as the mediating variable between organizational culture and corporate performance in this study, measured using five arrows, which consists of usefulness, economy, reliability, timeliness, and flexibility. Corporate account acted as the dependent variable in this research and is represented by Return on Assets (ROA), Earnings before Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), Return on Investment (ROI), Return on Equity (ROE), and Economic Value Added (EVA). There are three hypotheses in total, which will be analyzed and tested in this study by using the WarpPLS 5.0 software. The outcome of this research revealed that organizational culture has a highly significant impact on accounting information systems and corporate performance. However, accounting information systems did not substantially impact corporate performance as an independent or mediating variable.",
