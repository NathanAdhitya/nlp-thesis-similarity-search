  "title": "The Children fight back: power relations in the other boleyn girl",
  "abstract": "In this historical fiction text The Other Boleyn Girl, the children are treated as the parents? possession whose lives are not the children to decide. The parents are seen as the figure of domineering power and the children must not defy the parents? decision because of protocol. Using Foucault?s theory of power relation supported with the theories of female body, the way the power relations within filial is analyzed to prove that somehow the children are more powerful. The outcome shows that the children are indeed powerful in their own way. Thus, the ancient belief that the one in higher position is obviously the more powerful one should be reconsidered since the result of this analysis begs to differ.",
