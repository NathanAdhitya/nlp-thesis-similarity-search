  "title": "The Battle of the minds in the case of multiple personality disorder in Michael Landers Peacock",
  "abstract": "This thesis deals with the battle of the minds between the host and the alter in John Skillpa in the case of Johnâ€™s Multiple Personality Disorder in the movie Peacock. Through the battle of the minds between John and his alter personality Emma, I want to find out the cause, the process, and the result of the battle. To analyze the battle of the minds between the host and the alter, I am using the theory of Multiple Personality Disorder. In my analysis of the battle of the minds, I find out that the battle of the minds is caused by the existence of the alter, the resolutions of the host, and the interference of the alter. I also discover that the battle of the minds proceeds with the attack of the alter and the defense of the host. Finally, I find that the result of the battle is the victory of the alter. I furthermore learn that in order to create a battle of the minds in the case of Multiple Personality Disorder, there should be at least two personalities who oppose each other. I also learn that although an alter in the case of Multiple Personality Disorder is supposed to help the host in dealing with the traumatically abuse, an alter can also attack the host, like in the case of an alter who functions to maintain the attachment of the host and a caretaker figure.",
