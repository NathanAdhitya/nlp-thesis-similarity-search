  "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with equality and independence as the feminist elements reflected through the character of Emma Woodhouse as seen in Jane Austen?s Emma. I am interested in equality and independence because I want to promote these elements of feminism toward women in particular. I want to know how equality and independence are reflected through the character of Emma Woodhouse. This thesis is intended to find out the ways equality and independence are reflected through Emma Woodhouse. To do this, I use cultural approach with the theories of feminism, and the historical background of the nineteenth century women. With the help of these tools, I find out that equality and independence as the feminist elements are reflected through Emma?s matchmaking, and through her relationship with Mr. Knightley. In the end, I conclude that actually Emma reflects the feminist elements of equality and independence, and that these elements have helped her to be a significant person.",
