  "title": "Developing a better communication and co-ordination between housekeeping and Front Office Departement in Golden Tulip Schiphol",
  "abstract": "This report is going to discuss about the problem, which is based on our observation that occurred between two department; Front Office and Housekeeping Department. It is defined as a communication problem that has possibility caused by different point of view in the management system, different interest and the vision of each department, the inflexibility in running the task. The writers think it is very necessary to put the matter into the surface because basically it will affect the work environment within the employees themselves and it will appear in how are they going to treat the guests. The methodology that will be used in order to create the bridge to overcome the problem is interviewing, distributing the questionnaire, and observing. By doing all the methodology that the writers have already mentioned above, the writers will arrive to the answer from the formulation of solution in order to make a nice bridge which will satisfy the whole variables in the Golden Tulip School.",
