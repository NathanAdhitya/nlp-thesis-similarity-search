  "abstract": "The present study was conducted to find out the English syntactic structure of a three-year-old boy. This study was aimed to investigate the types of sentences produced by the subject and the two main patterns namely functional and categorical. The writer used the theories proposed by Crystal (1976) and Quirk et.al. (1985) as her main review of related literature. This research was a descriptive research. The writer got the data from the spontaneous English utterances produced by the subject. Then she defined the types of sentences, complete or incomplete sentences. Finally, she analyzed the data to identify the functional and categorical patterns of each sentence. The findings show that the subject produced both types of sentences, complete and incomplete sentences. The subject produced some functional patterns of complete and incomplete sentences. The subject also produced various categorical patterns. It was found that N (noun), Pron (pronoun) and NP (noun phrase) fill S (subject); P (predicate) is filled by V (Verb) and VP (Verb phrase), O (object) is filled by N (noun) and NP (noun phrase). Moreover, C (complement) is filled by Adj (adjectives); A (adverbial) is filled by PP (prepositional phrase) and Adv.P (adverb phrase).",
