  "title": "Compliment responses produced by young and old males toward strangers and close friends",
  "abstract": "This research focuses on the compliment responses produced by young and old males in the Surabaya, mainly to find the types of compliment responses produced by young male and by old male in Surabaya as well as to find the differences and/or similarities in the compliment responses produced by them. The main theory used in the research is the twelve types of compliment responses by Herbert (1989). By using the questionnaires adapted from Blum-Kulka (1982), the writer analyzed the application of the types of compliment responses in each sentence in the questioner. There were also some interesting findings in this research. Both old and young males used \"appreciation token\" towards strangers. As for compliments given by close friends, the old males used \"no acknowledgement\" the most. Another interesting finding was \"praise upgrade\" because it was the most dominant type of response used by young males toward close friends but it never occured if the compliments were given by strangers. It means that social distance does affect the way people respond to a compliment. Besides social distance, there also some factors that affect the way people respond to a compliment, namely age and culture.",
