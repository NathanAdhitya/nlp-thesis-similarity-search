  "title": "A Study of Julius Caesar's Wisdom and its paradox in Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra",
  "abstract": "In this thesis, the writer tries to analyze the wisdom of Julius Caesar and its paradox based on Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra. She chooses to analyze the main character, Julius Caesar, because critic says that \"Caesar is at least nine-tenth Shaw\". Therefore, by analyzing Caesar's wisdom and its paradox, the writer can also learn more about the playwright. She would like to discuss Shaw's idea of wisdom and prove that the paradox exists only because Caesar's intelligence and morality is beyond the other characters' understanding. Through the topic chosen, she hopes that she can learn Caesar's wisdom. The writer uses characterization and conflict as a literary approach, and she also uses theory of wisdom and virtue to support her analysis. In the analysis, the writer wants to show that behind Caesar's action that is regarded by other characters as merely foolishness, lays wisdom underneath. In the end, the writer finds out that although Caesar's actions are questioned by the other characters, it proves to be wise after all.",
