  "title": "Promoting the products offered by \"La Lisa Hotel\" with an effective promotional video",
  "abstract": "The main problem that La Lisa currently facing is the potential customers did not give good feedback while the sales team offered the products. Most importantly, this promotional tool failed to project La Lisa uniqueness. Because of this problem, La Lisa could not get the attention from as potential customers mostly from all over Surabaya such as government officers. Therefore, the solution to the problem is to make a promotional video. With this video, the potential customers will be more interested when they see motion pictures highlighting the unique selling points, rather than just a brochure.",
