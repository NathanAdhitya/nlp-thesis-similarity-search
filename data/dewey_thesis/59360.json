  "title": "Financial reporting quality on dividend payout policy during pandemic",
  "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted Indonesian business cycle and operations, leading to stock market decline and reduced average dividend distribution as well as profitability especially for manufacturing companies. This study investigates the pandemicâ€™s influence on financial reporting quality in Indonesia and its relationship to dividend payout policy. We collected 455 observations from IDX-listed manufacturing companies (2018-2021) and processed them using descriptive statistics and logit regression with three models in Stata. This paper uses real earnings management as a proxy for financial reporting quality. Consistent with the outcome view, the logit regression results suggest that financial reporting quality is affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, the three models unanimously display that financial reporting quality has a significant effect towards dividend policy.",
