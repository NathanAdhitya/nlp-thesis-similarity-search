  "title": "A Study of satire in Richardson's Pamela",
  "abstract": "Richardson 's Pamela is a story about a master who tries to seduce h is own maid. Since the work of Eighteenth Century is full with satire; therefore, it is interested to find out the element of satire in Pamela. However, by knowing the way the satirists present the story, the characteristics of satire can be found in Richardson 's work. The satire in Pamela is revealed through Pamela, Mr. B and Lady Davers. The condition of England in the Eighteenth Century is also reflected through the work of Richardson. In satire readers can see the contrast between the real world and the ideal world of the author. By satir izing the condition of England at the time, the social code on women, marriage, and also the morality of the bourgeois are revealed throughout the story. The satiric monologues that Richardson uses in Pamela is successfully revealed through Pamela. From her, the ''ironic mask'' is used effectively so that the ideal world according to Richardson comes up throughout the story. The irony and exaggeration, in this case, are used in order to prove the satire in Pamela.",
