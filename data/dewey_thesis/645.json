  "title": "A Study on the causes of Kilroy's failure in Tennessee Williams' Camino Real",
  "abstract": "This thesis is about Kilroy?s failure in Tennessee Williams? Camino Real. Tennessee Williams? Camino Real is meant to symbolize the worst in a contemporary society in which the power of money destroys human qualities. It stresses honor and man? s own sense of dignity. The writer discusses Kilroy?s failure in getting respect in Camino Real as an object of discussion. Through this study, the writer wants to show Kilroy?s failure and the causes of Kilroy?s failure. Here, the writer uses theories of characterization and conflict to analyze the problem. The writer analyzes that Kilroy fails in getting respect and it is caused by his funny or unusual appearance, his inability to prove his past, his not having money, his willingness to be a patsy. Because Kilroy depends on his past glory, he fails to gain respect.",
