  "title": "Alternative design for trog bridge in Tiel, the Netherlands",
  "abstract": "Tiel is one of the cities in The Netherlands; since transportation is a very important factor, especially for a developed country, a road and a railway bridge are going to be built in Tiel. Because the space available in The Netherlands is very limited, the road is going to be built beneath the railway bridge. And for that, The Holland Rail Consult select the “trog” bridge for the type of the bridge that they are going to use. Since this Underground Passage project covers very wide aspects, this final project will be only on the alternative solution of the “trog” bridge. The design will be done by selecting another type of bridge that can be used for this project, analyzing the structures of that alternative bridge. After the analyzing of the structures, there is some cost estimating for this alternative bridge. In the end, the result of this final project is a comparison between the “trog” bridge and the alternative bridge, which one can best be applied depending on the priority given.",
