  "abstract": "This thesis is about a psychoanalytic study of Oskar Schindler?s reasons to save the Jews in Thomas Keneally?s Schindler?s List. I choose this topic because I am interested in Schindler?s character, which first concerns about money only but in the end concerns about other people?s life. The analysis is about how the superego of Schindler overcomes his id and his ego. The scope of this thesis is Schindler?s id, ego and superego and the analysis is limited to the main character, Oskar Schindler and the other two supporting characters, Itzhak Stern and Amon Goeth. I use the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud in the interaction among the id, the ego, and the superego as the main theory in analyzing it. From the analysis, I conclude that Oskar Schindler who first comes to Krakow only to make fortune in the end changed. I found out that at first Schindler?s id is dominant. Then, the two supporting characters and the environment play an important role in developing his superego, until his superego overcomes his id and his ego. Finally, the imbalance of Oskar Schindler?s id, ego, and superego does not always end in bad things, but it can result in good things as Schindler does.",
