  "abstract": "Risk management plays fundamental roles on bank activities, include credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. New Frontier Solutions Pte. Ltd in co-operation with Bank X has developed a credit scoring model as credit risk management application. The credit scorecard considered three aspects, which are moral risk, business risk, and financial risk factors. The current credit risk model is measured its performance by calculating the GINI Coefficient and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov value also the model parameters are re-estimated. The new model is considered to be built not only by statistical approach which is using Logistic Regression method but applied the business logic as well. The model is validated by measuring the power discriminatory of the model to separate between ?good? customer and ?bad? customer and also carried out the population stability test of the model.",
