  "title": "Aleida’s poisonous parenting styles in orange is the New Black",
  "abstract": "This thesis aims to provide an analysis into the specific type of poisonous parenting style Aleida Diaz has in Orange is the New Black, the reason why she adopts such poisonous parenting styles, and the consequences that result from her poisonous parenting styles on her children. The theories I use in analyzing this study are Shea M. Dunham and Shannon B. Dermer’s theory of poisonous parenting styles, specifically the Dismissive Parent and the Contemptuous Parent; Nancy Chodorow’s Mother-Daughter Relationship theory to understand the underlying reason behind Aleida’s adoption of her poisonous parenting styles; and Diana Baumrind’s Uninvolved or Neglectful Parenting Style to examine the consequences of Aleida’s parenting styles on her children. Ultimately, the finding of my analysis will reveal that there is a vicious cycle of these poisonous parenting styles that turns out difficult to break from one generation to the next.",
