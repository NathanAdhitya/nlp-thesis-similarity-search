  "abstract": "This study aims at finding out insertion sequences and their types, which are post-first insertion sequences and pre-second insertion sequences, on conversations about sex and daily activities. As the data, the writer recorded conversations between two participants about sex and their daily activities. To do the analyses, the writer referred to the theories of insertion sequences by Coulthard (1985) and Schegloff (2007). The findings of the study show that topic proffering influences the number of insertion sequences which exist on the conversation. On topic about sex, there were less insertion sequences because the participants felt uncomfortable to talk, which caused a sequence closure. While on the topic about daily activities, there were more insertion sequences because the participants felt comfortable to talk, and therefore, there were many expansions. Nevertheless, it can be concluded from this study that topic proffering did not significantly influence the functions of insertion sequences. The fact was that both conversations, about sex and daily activities, concerned with the same functions why participants produced insertion sequences.",
