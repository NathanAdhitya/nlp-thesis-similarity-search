  "title": "Translation errors in the English-translated abstracts of some Management Department theses in Petra Christian University",
  "abstract": "The use of English language occurs in a variety of areas such as politics, economics, technology, and education. Besides our country needs to absorb ideas from western, we must be able to express our ideas to the advanced countries by translating them into English. Petra takes this role. Students of Petra Christian University are required to write the thesis abstract in English. We notice not all Petra students have good skill in English, particularly in doing translation. There are some translation errors that occurred. Therefore, the writer wants to reveal the common problems in terms of content and grammatical errors. In order to find out the content error, the writer uses Newmark?s and Barnet & Stubbs? classifications. For the grammatical error, she uses Richards? classification. The writer takes the data from some Management Department theses in Petra Christian University. From the quantity of the content errors in translation, majority of Management Department students make left out and different sense errors. For the grammatical error, the predominant errors are error in the production of verb group and miscellaneous error.",
