  "title": "Request strategies used by an owner of the Chinese language center to the employees based on routine and non routine tasks",
  "abstract": "The way people ask request is different depending on many social factors. One of them is routine or non routine tasks. In this thesis, the writer did a research how the owner used request strategy for routine and non routine tasks towards her employees. The purpose of this thesis is to find out whether there are differences of request strategies used by the owner toward the employees based on routine and non-routine tasks. In analyzing the data, the writer applied Blum-Kulka, House and Kasper (1989) theory of request as the main theory. In addition, the writer also used Holmes and Reed and Senderso (1999) and Holmes (2001) as supporting theories. From the data analysis, the writer discovered that the most frequent request strategy used by the owner for routine tasks is mood derivable which is included into direct strategy. Then the most frequent strategy that is used for non routine tasks is query preparatory which is included into indirect strategy. Furthermore, the writer analyzed the differences and similiarities between the requests that are used for routine and non-routine tasks. Here, the writer found both of them. For the conclusion, the writer can conclude that tasks and social status influenced request strategies.",
