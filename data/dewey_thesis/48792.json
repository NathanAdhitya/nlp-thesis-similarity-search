  "title": "Increasing brand awareness of Sunshine Children Centre by highlighting its unique selling points in a promotional video",
  "abstract": "Sunshine Children Centre is an English Course established in 2005 by Sri Mulyani Gondowardono, better known as Miss Yani. This course teaches students from 2 years old until grade 6 elementary school. Sunshine Children Centre’s main problem is the decreasing number of students due to the changes from offline to online classes and the fact that this course does not have any promotional tool. Therefore, the best solution is to make a promotional video and upload it on social media platforms such as Instagram. The duration of the video is 1 minute because it is the best duration for a promotional video, according to Klass (2018). I surveyed to find out the Unique Selling Points of this course. The first USP is that this course helps students with their homework and gives additional assignments. Second, this course also offers classes for small and private groups depending on the students’ needs. Third, this place accepts students from both regular and immersion curriculum. Finally, Sunshine Children Centre will expectedly attract new people and maintain the old and current students by having a promotional video.",
