  "title": "The Influence of father's rejection toward his sons as reflected through the study of the characters and their conflicts in Steinbeck's east of Eden",
  "abstract": "East of Eden is one of the interesting novels to discuss, because its story is about the relationship between father and sons; the influence of the father?s rejection toward his sons. Furthermore, we can see the father?s unfair treatment toward his sons in this novel. By analyzing Adam?s and Charles Trask characterization and their conflicts, the thesis writer proves in this thesis that the father?s unfair treatment toward his sons causes bad effects and unhappiness of both of his sons, not only to the rejected son but also to the beloved son?s life finally. Cyrus?s unfair treatment toward Adam and Charles, his own sons, make them feel suffer and depression. That unfair treatment influences Adam?s and Charles? characters. Both of them become hateful and unrespectable towards their own father, because they feel that their father does not love but reject them with his attitude. Moreover, Adam and Charles face some conflicts in their lives that are very hard for them to solve. These conflicts cause the disharmony relationship between Cyrus, Adam and Charles. In conclusion, the thesis writer can conclude that the father?s treatment toward his sons during their childhood can influence his son?s way of life; whether it is good or bad, it depends on how a father treats his children everyday.",
