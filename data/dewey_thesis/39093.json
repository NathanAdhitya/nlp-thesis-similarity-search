To gain this advantage, the factor determining the outcome of Intellectual Capital Disclosure (lCD) is very crucial. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the influence of company characteristics (company size, debt level, company age, ownership concentration, profitability and auditor reputation) towards ICD in Indonesia Property & Real Estate companies from the period of 2012-2014 using multiple regression model.
