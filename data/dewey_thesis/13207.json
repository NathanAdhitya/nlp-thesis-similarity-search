  "title": "A Study of Judge Brack's disbelief in Hedda Gabler's downfall in Hendrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler through discourse analysis",
  "abstract": "This project is a discourse analysis on HenrikIbsen's Hedda Gabler, in which the main focus of this Istudy is utterances of Hedda toward Brack as characters in the play. Those utterances are analysed to find out the reasons of Brack's disbelief on Hedda's downfall, that is her suicide at the end of the play. Throughout the play it can be known that Brack, as Hedda's secret lover, is the only character who has much involved in communication with her and knows almost everything concerning with Hedda. Therefore, it raises a big ques-tion when she commits suicide, Brack is unable to believeit. In doing the research, the writer applies the Speech Act theory by examining the locutions, illocu-tions, and perlocutions on Hedda's utterances toward Brack. The locutions and illocutions are searched for to see the difference between what she says and means, whereas the search for the perlocutions is to know whether Brack is able to capture what Hedda means (the illocution) or not through his answers. Finally, from the done analysis, the writer con-cludes that Brack's indifference on some illocutions of Hedda's utterances make him unable to believe her sui-cide after he sees himself her corpse stretching out on the sofa.",
