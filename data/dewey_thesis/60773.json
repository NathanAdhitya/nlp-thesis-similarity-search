  "title": "Lionessheart: A screenplay of Firstborn Daughter’s struggles in family and society",
  "abstract": "Eldest Daughter Syndrome, more commonly recognized as Child Parentification of the firstborn daughter, is a term used to describe the phenomenon where parents burden their firstborn daughter with the responsibility of taking care of everything. Child parentification is more common in Asian families due to cultural differences. As revealed by Ang and Goh (2006), Asian parents, including Indonesian parents, tend to have an authoritarian parenting style that emphasizes strictness, harshness, and the expectation of obedience from their children. Using Gregor Jurkovic’s theory of ‘Lost Childhood,’ this creative thesis will highlight the difficulties of being a parentified child, the impacts on their psyche, and potential solutions. It will also explore how individuals can deal with their trauma by seeking support and empowerment from their socioemotional environment. Through the screenplay, it is shown that the parentified character struggles with anger and resentment towards her parents, stress, and identity disruption. The main impact of these struggles is deep trauma, which is addressed through empowerment and support in her socioemotional growth from her friends.",
