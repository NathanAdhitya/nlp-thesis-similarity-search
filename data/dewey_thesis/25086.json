  "abstract": "The writer of this thesis talks about Lawrence's ideas about psychology. It is about a world where the unconscious is as manifest as the conscious. The Rainbow by D.H Lawrence tells the story of three generations of an English family, concentrating, in each, on the cultural, moral, and religious problems of the young. The writer of this thesis is interested in discussing The Rainbow to find out Lawrence's attitude about love, morality, and religion. This thesis analyzes them through the psychological point of view of the three Brangwens' generations. They are Tom and Lydia, Will and Anna, and Ursula. From the marriage of the first and second generation, the writer finds that D.H Lawrence writes about the relationship between men and women in their marriage. While Ursula, the last generation, belongs to the Modern Movement, whose love affair with Skrebensky is quite an experience for her. Through the topic presented in this thesis the readers will know D.H Lawrence's idea about men and women and their relationship in marriage. His concept of love, morality, and religion is important to know.",
