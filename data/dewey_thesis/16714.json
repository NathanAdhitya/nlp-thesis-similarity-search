  "title": "Pengaturan kecepatan (RPM) motor induksi satu phase, 0,028 KW, 50 Hz, 220 V, 1400 RPM dengan metode pulse widtg modulation (PWM)",
  "abstract": "One of the inverter methods is Pulse Width Modulation methods. The sinus digital signal wich is genereted by Pulse Width Modulation signal is produced by minimum system 8031. The minimum system 8031 has also settled the entire work process: circuit included, LCD control, keypad and devider in order to dispose frequency and voltage. Based of experiment results, the utilisation of Pulse Width Modulation methods to inverter, this fact can be indentivied from the aplicatoin of smaller current for smaller RPM, so mat linear graphic can be drawn for the relation of RPM and current The toque produced fits the comparison of the current declination to frequency. The experimental error is 1,0412%.",
