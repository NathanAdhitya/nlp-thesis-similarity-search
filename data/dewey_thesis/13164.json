  "abstract": "Dostoyevsky was a nineteenth Russian author who loved to write about the psychological aspects of life, one of which is the psychology of the insulted and humiliated, and their sufferings. The Insulted and Humiliated has disclosed the psychological condition of the insulted and humiliated through the major characters, Nikolai, Natasha, and Nellie. They have been insulted and humiliated, and defense mechanisms occur as reactions in defending themselves. According to Sigmund Freud, defense mechanisms are techniques used to defend the self against threats and anxieties. The questions that arise here are which defense mechanism occurs in the characters? reactions, and what factors have led them in the use of particular mechanisms. This study is to analyze the particular mechanisms employed by the three characters in defending themselves againsts insults and humiliations, and the reasons of their occurance. In the analysis, literary approach, which is methods of characterization, is used, and then as a supporting theories, defense mechanisms are employed. In this thesis, the three characters? reactions are analyzed, and their mechanisms are identified. It is found that there are some factors underlying the occurrence of particular mechanisms.",
