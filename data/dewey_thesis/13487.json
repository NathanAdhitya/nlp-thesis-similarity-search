  "abstract": "A study of Henry's love in Thackeray's Henry Esmond is the theme of this thesis. In this thesis, the writer wants to analyze Henry's feeling for Rachel and Henry's feeling toward Beatrix, and why he finally chooses Rachel to be married and not Beatrix. In the analysis, the writer compares Henry's love for Rachel and Henry's love toward Beatrix. Henry's feeling for these two persons is unique because they are mother and daughter, Rachel is the mother while Beatrix is her daughter. Rachel is Lord Francis' wife, the fourth Viscount. In order to analyze Heniy's love development for Rachel, the writer uses literary theories of characterization and psychological theories of love. Finally, the writer concludes that Henry's love for Rachel develops while Henry's love for Beatrix is only an infatuation and a sublimation of his love toward Rachel because he is refused by Rachel. At last the most important finding that the writer gets is that love cannot be based on age, wealth or fame.",
