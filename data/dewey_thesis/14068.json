Besides, the thesis writer sees that there are some influences in the life of the main female character that affect her character traits. Although the main female character is educated based on her custom where she belongs, Southern, her character traits are closer to the Victorian standard. In her marriage's life, she tries to do everything for her family, her husband and her children. She believes that what she does for her husband and her children is to make them happy. She does not care about herself. The only thing that comes out from her mind is to sacrifice her happiness to others. She is to suffer only for her husband and children.
