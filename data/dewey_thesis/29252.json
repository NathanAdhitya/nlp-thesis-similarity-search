  "abstract": "In this research, the writer shows that language use can0 support the relationship, even for reconciliation. The writer researches the language use of husband and wife in their reconciliation processes and its connection to the reconciliation processes. She uses a film, entitled “Not Easily Broken” (2009) as the representative of reconciliation of husband and wife. She researches the Speech Act of Dave and Clarice (main characters) during their reconciliation processes. The writer uses the Speech Act theory (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969; Yule, 1996) as the main theory and the stages of reconciliation process (Huyse, 2003) as the supporting theory. In the findings of the research, the highest illocution is ‘Representative’ and automatically, the highest perlocution is from ‘Representative’. In the first and second stages, most of the perlocution (the highest one is ‘Doesn’t: accept/believe/agree the statement, information, etc’) does not match but in the last stage, the reconciliation is accomplished. In the last stage, all perlocutions match to the illocution (the highest one is ‘Accepts/believes/agrees the statement, information, etc’). The conclusion is a couple should accept the fact and truth to each other to accomplish reconciliation process.",
