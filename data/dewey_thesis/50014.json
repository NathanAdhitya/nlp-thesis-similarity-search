  "title": "The study of Sinbad's personality change in Magi: adventure of Sinbad and Magi: Labyrinth of Magic Manga Series",
  "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the journey of Sinbad, the main character of Magi: Adventure of Sinbad and Magi: Labyrinth of Magic Manga series. These manga series present the adventure of an ordinary young boy named Sinbad who became a hero and saved his world from destruction. Sinbad will go through several stages in his journey in order to become a hero. The result of undergoing those stages will affect Sinbad’s personality change that will slowly transform him into a different person than he was before. Because of this, I am interested in analyzing the process of Sinbad’s personality development in his journey to become a hero. I use the monomyth theory to analyze the process of Sinbad’s journey from a nobody to a hero, and the theory of personality development to analyze Sinbad’s personality change throughout his journey. First, I discuss Sinbad’s personality before he embarks on his journey. Second, I discuss the process of Sinbad’s personality change. Lastly, I discuss Sinbad’s personality after his journey.",
