  "title": "The Role of NICE center in supporting small and medium handicraft industries in East Java",
  "abstract": "Many handicraft industries in East Java who want to export to Japan are lacking in export knowledge and experience, and don?t have any channel to enter that market. Besides, the differences in culture and value between Japanese and Indonesian become the hardest obstacle for them to solve. The writer uses secondary data analysis as the research method in this report, and the writer find that the buying decisions of Japanese importers in the handicraft export business is based not only on a balance between quality and price, but also attached to design, package, label and delivery time of the product. Besides, it is also important to gain the trust of the importer. There are some points to be noted in entering the Japanese market. First, East Java handicraft industries should expand their export know-how and international trade information. Second, increase awareness of the cultural differences among nations. Third, develop skills and strategies to produce a handicraft product that matches Japanese value and taste. PT.LINIA should support them by providing information, training, and consultation to help them in solving their problem in exporting to Japan, so they are able to enter the Japanese market and meet the demand of that market.",
