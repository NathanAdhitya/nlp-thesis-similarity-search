  "title": "Is it too late? Exploring self-actualisation of a self-proclaimed artist in a restrictive Indonesian family",
  "abstract": "This creative work, which is realistic fiction with poetry, retells the story of an aspiring artist and his struggles for self-actualization throughout his life, mainly because he had a very restrictive parent. It explores self-actualization in terms of finding one’s niche and purpose in life while also adding filial piety (and how it can interfere with one’s happiness) to the mix. To understand this better, I have used Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and Bedford and Yeh’s Dual Filial Piety Model. The story itself is set in a slightly-altered real world. It will show how Richard, the protagonist, chose to pursue his artistry to self-actualize and, in facing challenges related to his self-actualization, takes charge by seeking assistance from his confidantes to confront his archenemy.",
