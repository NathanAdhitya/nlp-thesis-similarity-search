  "title": "A comparison between Disney earlier and recent princesses of the third generation of Disney animated films as seen in Rapunzel in Tangled and Moana in Moana",
  "abstract": "In this thesis, I want to analyze Rapunzel and Moana as princess characters in the two Disney Princess films entitled Tangled and Moana. This thesis talks about the girl power characteristics in identifying Rapunzel and Moana. There is a difference in the terms of bravery, independence, and intelligence in Rapunzel as the earlier princess and Moana as the recent princess of the third generation of Disney Princesses. In this study, as a result, I found that in terms of bravery, Moana as the recent princess is more daring to make decisions and take risks when compared to Rapunzel as the earlier princess of the third generation. In terms of independence, it can also be seen that Rapunzel still seems to rely more on other people to help her find a way, and protect herself, in contrast to Moana who can find the destination by herself and work together with other people and make them become her partners. In terms of intelligence, both Rapunzel and Moana are good at managing their daily activities but in terms of solving problems Rapunzel still uses the power of magical stuff, unlike Moana who actually uses all her mind and strength to solve the problems she faces.",
