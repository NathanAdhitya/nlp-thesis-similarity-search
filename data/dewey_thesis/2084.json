  "title": "A Study on the main character in facing the world as seen in Forster's Howards End",
  "abstract": "This thesis talks about E.M. Forster's fourth novel, Howards End. The focus of the discussion is on the characterization of the main character, Margaret Schlegel while she is nearly thirties. Margaret is a romantic person at the beginning of the story. Her idea about literature is shaped by her father who adores literature. Margaret's character develops when she encounters an outsider's view of life that is different from her. Her romantic view of life makes her think that having the appreciation toward literature is important for her life and others who also know literature, because it will make people alive in the midst of their misery. Besides her romantic view of life, she is also very naive. This makes her blind to see the reality of human nature which has goodness and weakness. After seeing and facing her problems, she develops into a different person in facing reality. She has realized her false idea and she can see reality in better way.",
