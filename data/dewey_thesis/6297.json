  "title": "A Study on main character's maturity process as seen in Jane Austen's sense and sensibility",
  "abstract": "This thesis is about Marianne?s maturity process in Jane Austen?s Sense and Sensibility. I choose this topic because I am interested in Marianne who is in the beginning immature; however, at the end of the story, she becomes a mature woman. The purpose of the thesis is to reveal the process by which Marianne achieves her maturity. The scope of this thesis is the process of Marianne?s maturity and the analysis is limited only on the main female character, Marianne. I will use literary approach and employ as tools the theories of characterization and conflict. I will use the psychological concepts of immaturity and maturity to support my analysis. From the analysis, I find out that Marianne changes from unwise to become wise, from narrow-minded to become broad-minded, from irresponsible to become responsible and from self-centered to become socio-centered. I find out that Marianne is changing from an immature woman to become a mature woman after experiencing and facing conflicts. I finally conclude that the process happening in Marianne?s life is hard and not easy.",
