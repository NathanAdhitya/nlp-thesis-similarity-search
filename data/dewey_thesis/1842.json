  "title": "The Factors of Nat's character development as seen in Louisa May Alcott's Little Men",
  "abstract": "Little men is a novel by Louisa May Alcott that tells about a young boy, Nathaniel Blake, who experiences character development through his new life at Plumfield school. In the beginning and at the end of the story it is clear the Nat experiences character development. I am curious to know the factors that influence Nat?s character development. Through the analysis, I want to reveal Nat?s former characters as a child and the factors that make him develop to be better. In the analysis, I use literary approach and employ literary theories of characterization and conflicts. I also use the psychological theory on character development of schoolaged children. In the conclusion, I find out that Nat?s former character traits are formed due to the bad treatments and abuses he received from his father. And the factors of his development are the love and friendship that Plumfield residences bring to him. So I conclude that his characters develop through the friendship, love, education, music and religion/moral he gets at Plumfield school.",
