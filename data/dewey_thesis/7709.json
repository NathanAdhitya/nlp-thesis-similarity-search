  "title": "The Study of translation strategy applied by Listiana Srisanti in the Indonesian translation of the novel \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\"",
  "abstract": "Translation is never as easy as it seems. There are many words, phrases or sentences that cannot be translated directly. Strategies are used to deliver the Source message and to get equivalent effect for the readers. This research studies the translation strategies applied by Listiana Srisanti in translating the novel ?Harry Potter And the Order of the Phoenix? into Indonesian, based on Mona Baker?s theory about translation strategy. The writer classifies the data into two classes, The Same Message and Not The Same Message based on the message of the Target text compared to the Source Language proposition. Then the writer analyzes the strategies. The writer finds that strategies applied by Listiana in The Same Message are translation by more general word, less expressive word, cultural substitution, loanword, paraphrase using related and unrelated word, and omission. Strategies applied by Listiana in Not The Same Message are the same with The Same Message, except translation by more general word and loanword. The writer also concludes that TL message can be added, omitted, modulated, and changed completely compared to the SL proposition in order to apply the strategies.",
