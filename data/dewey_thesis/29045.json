  "title": "The Indonesian translation of the 4th edition of Donald Duck bilingual comic",
  "abstract": "Bilingual books are in trends today. One interesting purpose for publishing those bilingual books is to teach English while people also enjoy reading those books. This research studies the Indonesian translation of a story entitled “Mickey Mouse, Showdown in Shambor” which is taken from the 4th Edition of Donald Duck Bilingual Comic. The Indonesian translation is analyzed based on the same message between SL and TL, translation strategies, and translation shifts in order to prove whether this comic can be used as a media for learning English. The data is classified into two main parts, which are The Same Message part and Not The Same Message part. There are some findings here. First, the translations which contain the same message are not always accurate translations; some of them are less accurate translation. Second, the translation strategies and the translation shifts which are applied appropriately produce accurate translations; if they are not applied appropriately, less accurate translations and even different-message translations are produced. Third, incorrect translation of word(s) can produce different message and sometimes it can also produce the same message although less accurate. The overall result shows that the comic can be used as an adequate media for learning English.",
