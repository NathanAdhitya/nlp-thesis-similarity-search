  "title": "Supplementary materials for English lesson grade seven in Elia Christian Middle School",
  "abstract": "This project is based on the writer’s internship in Elia Christian Junior High School from April, 7 to June, 5 2015. The writer thought that it was a good thing to make supplementary materials as a final project because of some problems the writer faced earlier during the internship. There was not sufficient interesting material in the textbook and lack of students’ participation in the classroom. The writer wrote some suggested supplementary materials that he thought was good according to the analysis of the textbook to supplement the material written in the KTSP curriculum textbook. By having some creative activities during the lessons, for example, playing some games related to the teaching points the students are currently learning, the students hopefully can change the habit of their English learning. The students are expected to be more active in learning English, and increase their participation that they will also be more willing to support the teaching and learning process in class with greater effort.",
