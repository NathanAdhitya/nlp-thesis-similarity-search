  "title": "O'Neil's survival tactics in gaining equality in David Twohy's, G. I Jane",
  "abstract": "G. I Jane is an action film that I choose to be analyzed because I am interested in the female character of this film named Jordan O’Neil, who is able to show her tactics in gaining gender equality in the Military. Thus, I want to know how she overcomes the difficulties in the Military training as a woman. In this thesis, I am trying to answer it by showing the ways or tactics that she uses in overcoming the difficulties in the Military. I am going to use the concepts of Stacie R. Furia which are contradictory tactic, overcompensation and demonstrating proficiency at the required tasks in order to analyze the ways she encounters it. In adapting with all the requirements, O’Neil wants to prove that she is as capable as any other male candidate there. Moreover, she also wants to overcome her differences from men so that they can acknowledge her as a part of them. In conclusion, O’Neil can show her survival tactics in gaining equality because she is willing to overcome the difficulties in the Military.",
