  "abstract": "Lifestyle can be used as means to express one’s beliefs. Cheney’s (2006) definition of lifestyle allows us to look at lifestyles through various perspectives. Lesbian lifestyle is one of those perspectives, being a lifestyle based on understandings share by members of lesbian community. The researcher seeks to find how the lesbians community expressed their lifestyle, the dominant group’s gaze to the lifestyle, and the lesbian community’s reaction for the gaze. Through the verbal and nonverbal communication. This research uses Multimodal Discourse Analysis and Special Parlance as its theories, while using qualitative analysis for its approach. The result of the research states that members of lesbian community expresses certain emotions through verbal and nonverbal communications for their reactions, mainly: defense, distrust, sadness, helplessness, nervousness, and anger. The emotions are result of the gaze by the dominant group, which is mainly based on prejudice and lesbian stereotype, and the emotions are used as a way by members of lesbian community to express themselves as lesbians and to communicate with each other when reacting to the dominant group’s gaze. When MLC aid each other, they have a better chance at overcoming unfair treatment/stereotype. They also express their identity by communicating with each other with their own language.",
