  "title": "The Role of product positioning strategy in increasing the sales of A-Mild cigarette kretek",
  "abstract": "A-Mild cigarette kretek filter is becoming one of the leading players in the Indonesian market share of cigarettes. PT. HM Sampoerna has removed Djarum's position from number 2 to number 3. As a result, PT. HM Sampoerna becomes the second-biggest cigarette company after Gudang Garam. How PT. HM Sampoerna does its business is very interesting to follow. Many new brands of cigarettes come and no longer go. Therefore, it is challenging for a new-cigarette product to join the market competition. However, this situation does not happen to A-Mild cigarette kretek; why A-Mild cigarette kretek's success is achieved by a hard fight in the tight market competition. To occupy a good place in the consumer's perception, PT. HM Sampoerna must be able to do the right product positioning strategy. With a position as the cigarette kretek with low tar and nicotine, A-Mild tries to join the market and gives a different taste to its consumer.",
