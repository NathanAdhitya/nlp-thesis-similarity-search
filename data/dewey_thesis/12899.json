  "title": "A Study of theme on nature through imagery in five of William Wordsworth's poems",
  "abstract": "In composing a poem, one of the important considerations is the imagery that a poet uses. In this thesis, the writer discusses how Wordsworth presents the theme on nature through the imagery in his poem. The poems that are going to be analyzed are: \"Gipsies\", \"I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud\", \"My Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\", \"There Was A Boy\", and \"To The Cuckoo\". In the analysis, the writer describes the natural things that the poet uses. Then through these natural things she analyzes how the poet uses imagery. From the analysis, the writer finds out that in \"Gipsies\" the poet depicts nature to present one's existence. In \"I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud\" the poet pictures nature to show the change of mood. While in \"My Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\" the poet depicts nature to present the purity of mind. Then in \"There Was A Boy\" the poet uses nature to give an image to the shortness of human life. Lastly, in \"To The Cuckoo\" the poet brings nature to present the voice of hope.",
