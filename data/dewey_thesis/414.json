  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of the Effects of Bella?s Mercenary Attitude arid Her Change in Charles Dickens Our mutual friend Bella, the main character, is obsessed by wealth and luxurious life. Therefore, she wants to marry a man that she has never met before. First, I show what kind of attitude Bella has toward money and luxurious life. Then, I show how Bella changes in her attitude. I want to discuss Bclla?s attitude towards money before and after her change and to analyze the process of her change. I apply literary approach in doing the analysis. I use characterization, conflict, and setting as the literary devices, and I emphasize the knowledge of Victorian society, particularly on the social class and pcople?s way in valuing money as background knowledge. In the analysis, I find out that the main character, Bella Wilfer, has ndergone a big change after she witnesses that money can change a kind person into a rude one. Before the change she loves money and luxury very much and after the change she is no longer obsessed by money and luxurious life. Finally, she can value the bad and good sites of money.",
