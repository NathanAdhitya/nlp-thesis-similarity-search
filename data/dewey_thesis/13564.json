  "abstract": "This study is about the development of syntax of a three and a half year old child. The writer of this thesis focused her study on the utterances produced by the child's utterances in his daily conversations with his mother, his sister or the writer. The investigation of the clause pattern in the child's utterances was used to find out the development of syntax. In collecting the data, the writer used both a tape recorder and a note. The writer transcribed all data and analyzed it by separating the child's utterances in the three types of the sentences, they are statement sentences, question sentences and command sentences. As the next step of analysis, the writer identified the clause patterns of each utterance. The result of the findings shows that the child has acquired to use the complex sentences in his utterances especially in the statement sentences and its development can be seen in the second week to the fifth week. While the question and command sentences, the development can be seen in the fifth week. The child also constructed the passive forms in his utterances especially in his command sentences.",
