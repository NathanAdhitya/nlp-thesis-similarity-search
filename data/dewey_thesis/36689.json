  "title": "The importance of acknowledgement as a high class society for teenager in Alyson Noël’s Faking 19",
  "abstract": "The main purpose of this thesis is to show the importance of Alex’s desire to be acknowledged as a high class. Alex as a middle class person begins to show her changes since she enters high school. This analysis discusses the changes that happened to Alex. In the analysis, I use Georg Simmel’s theory about fashion and metropolitan lifestyle. I divided this analysis into three parts. The first part, it discusses what Alex does to get the acknowledgement. Second, it discusses the reasons and result behind her desire to be acknowledged as a high class. Finally, it discusses what Alex learns from her encounter with the high class. Through the analysis I find that Faking 19 shows an important moral lesson about life. Through the analysis I find that to be acknowledged as a high class is not the most important thing in life. The most important thing in life is what each individual can have and how they can be themselves",
