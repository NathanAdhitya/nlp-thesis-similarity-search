  "title": "A Study of human catalyst in Agatha Christie’s curtain",
  "abstract": "Scientific theories are reliable mainly for their accuracy in predicting outcomes. Consequently, studies on the implementation of scientific theories in human context are often met with initial skepticism. The purpose of this research is not to fit chemical catalysis laws into human contexts. Rather, it examines the modus operandi of a human catalyst with the help of Collision and Catalysis theories, as well as Human Chemistry theories. More specifically, this research studies Stephen Norton’s role as human catalyst in Agatha Christie’s Curtain. This study recognizes eleven modus operandi in the works of the human catalyst. At the same time, it indicates certain commonalities between the concepts of chemical and human catalysts. These findings are used to determine the five characteristics that represent, or can be embedded on, the human catalyst. These characteristics are versatility, savoir faire, perceptiveness, sociopathy, and intelligence. Conclusively, the findings of this research are aimed at the creation or identification of human catalysts as individuals with the ability to accelerate a process by lowering the energy barrier of the reaction without being consumed in the process.",
