  "title": "Companyâ€™s improvement by implementing total quality management in human resources department",
  "abstract": "We are all familiar with the customer's demand, higher quality at a lower cost in less time, and with the company's supplement: at a reasonable profit. The market is wearing us down, the pace is too fast, and the expectations are also great. We are being pulled in too many directions. Barely able to react when we should be anticipating and planning. We seek ways to know how everything they do fits together with the customer's requirement and the company's benefit on the range of disintegration. This paper's idea came from the writer's observation at a related company, and it was written from June 1995 until September 1995. Hopefully, this paper could help the following PBE students compare their thesis, and for PBE it-self, this book may add the library's actual management case collections.",
