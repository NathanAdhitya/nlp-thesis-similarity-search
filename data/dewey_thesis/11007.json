  "abstract": "This study deals with conversational analysis that is focused on interruption. Interruptions are violations of the turn-taking rules of conversation. The writer believes that there is a purpose behind an interruption. Thus, she would like to find the types of Miranda?s interruptions in the Devil Wears Prada, and the mostly used function of interruptions. The writer uses Yang?s (2003) theories, in which interruptions are classified into three types, that is competitive interruption, cooperative interruption, and unintentional interruption. While the functions behind interruptions are clarification, disagreement, shifting topic, supporting agreement, and completing. By using descriptive quantitative approach, the writer analyzed the data, and found that Miranda only used competitive interruptions. The functions behind her interruptions are clarification, disagreement, and shifting topic, and the most frequently used function is shifting topic.",
