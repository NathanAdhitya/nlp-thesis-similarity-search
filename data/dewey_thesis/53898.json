  "abstract": "The younger generation's interest in reading is declining, whereas reading is a very crucial form of education. Meanwhile, the proficiency in technology use is increasing, which means more than ever, information and education are much more accessible. To attract younger generation, a coloring pattern usually used by a famous animation studio, Studio Ghibli, will be used to color a picture storybook which tells the Indonesian folklore of Cindaku. Studio Ghibli colors reflect the theme of their films, such as environmentalism, which is also the theme of Cindaku, encouraging people to respect nature and keep a balance to preserve it while expanding their land. The author has finished creating the picture book but has not optimized the coloring techniques of Studio Ghibli and only uses several color palettes extracted from a previous research. The author concludes that they have their own style of art, which might not fit into another artistâ€™s style, therefore failing to convey nuances.",
