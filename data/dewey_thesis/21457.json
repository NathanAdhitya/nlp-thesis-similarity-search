  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of Absurd Characters in Ionesco's Rhinoceros. In Rhinoceros.all of the characters,except one character,Berenger,leave their human attributes and change into Rhinoceroses.This oddity makes the writer eager to analyze the absurd characters deeper. Because the absurd plays represent the absurdity of human being in the world,its elements,such as the characterization,have some certain characteristics. The absurd characters are usually unrecognizable, they do not have a family name or an origin;they are also funny,eventhough they do and act seriously; moreover, some of them are flat,they do not change from the beginning to the end of the story;and some of them,especially in Ionesco ?s plays,change their nature radically. And through the analysis,the writer wants to prove that the characters'in Ionesco's Rhinoqeros are unrecognizable,funny,and change their nature radically. Moreover,because of the lack of informations and references about absurd plays,the writer wants to give the reader some informations of the absurd play,especially the absurd characters.",
