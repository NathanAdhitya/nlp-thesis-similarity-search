  "title": "The application of regression analysis for estimating real estate market price",
  "abstract": "Market prices are essentially volatile from factor economy and local condition, may it be external and internal factors. The author analyses the market prices of the property using various independent variables that affect the price. Knowing the market price of a real estate property with an accurate model plays a big impact on market valuation at micro level. Market value is a term used to describe how much property assets are worth in the financial market, according to market participants. The author proposes another regression model using different independent variables in the form of quantitative data. The regression model used in this study is multiple linear regression. Keywords: Market price, independent variables, multiple linear regression",
