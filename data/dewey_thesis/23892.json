  "abstract": "Communications within human beings often fail to communicate the intended message and sometimes produce disagreements. These disagreement strategies are influenced by various factors, one of which is social distance. This thesis deals with how social distance influences someone in using disagreement strategies. The writer conducted a study of the disagreement strategies used by Greg toward his father and his future father-in-law in a movie entitled Meet the Fockers based on theory of disagreement strategies by Locher (2004). The writer used qualitative approach supported by quantitative data in developing her research. The findings revealed that Greg uses seven out of eight categories toward both his father and his future father-in-law. Moreover, in terms of frequency, non-mitigate disagreement strategy is used the most by Greg toward both his father and his future father-in-law. This is probably because men are not status-conscious so that they do not care about the impact of face-threatening acts, and showing disagreement directly is the easiest way to show disagreement. In conclusion, there were some other aspects aside from social distance that might influence the main character in uttering his disagreement.",
