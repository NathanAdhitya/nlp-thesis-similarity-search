This struggle is also faced by one of the old player of footwear industry in Indonesia, which is Rotelli. Marketing mix, which consists of product, price, place, and promotion, is one of the marketing tools that can be used to establish a competitive advantage by optimizing each element of it. Therefore, this research aims to analyze the impact of marketing mix elements both simultaneously and individually toward consumer purchasing decision. This research used multiple linear regression to test the relationship between these variables. In total 100 data are collected using simple random sampling method by distributing questionnaires both online and hardcopy to Rotelli's customers in Surabaya with age ranges between 20 until 50 years old who have bought and used Rotelli's product at least once. The result of this study shows that marketing mix both simultaneously and individually could influence consumers purchasing decision.
