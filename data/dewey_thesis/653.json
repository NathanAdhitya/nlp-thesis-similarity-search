  "abstract": "This study is conducted to reveal the use of word-formation process by the participants in `KISS' (Celebrities Hot Gossip) program. The writer is interested in observing the program, which presents the life style of Indonesian celebrities as the participants. The main theory that the writer used is the word-formation processes by Carol Jean Godby, supported by Kridalaksana Harimurti, which is related to Indonesian word-formation processes. The approach of this study is qualitative-descriptive; meaning that the data consists of words instead of numbers. She collects the data from one television program called 'Kisah Seputar Selebritis'. In analyzing the data, the writer wants to find out what types of English word-formation processes are used to form the Indonesian words. Then, she also wants to find out the type of word-formation processes that mostly occur in all-Indonesian words produced by the participants. As a result of the analysis, the frequent type of word-formation is `borrowing', which occurs in most of the others. The other processes are `derivation', `acronyms', et cetera. Finally, the writer hopes that her thesis research can be useful for the readers who are interested in analyzing the same topic as the writer does.",
