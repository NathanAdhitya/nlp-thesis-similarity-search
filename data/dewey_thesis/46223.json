  "abstract": "This thesis is a qualitative study on teacher’s roles and students’ behaviours in the movie The Ron Clark’s Story. The objectives of this study are to find out the teacher’s roles and students’ responses toward the teacher’s roles in the classroom scenes. This study was based on Harmer’s theory on teacher’s roles (2001, 2007) and Scarlett’s theory on students’ behaviours (2015). The data were collected from Ron Clark’s Story movie and transcript of the conversation in the film focusing on all of the classroom scenes. The findings show that the teacher applies six out of eight teacher’s roles: prompter, controller, resource, organizer, tutor, and participant. The findings of the students’ behaviours show that the students’ responses toward the teacher’s roles in the classroom are mostly having disruptive behaviours from scene one to four until it is starting to have significant changes to positive behaviours from scene five to eleven. It can be concluded that the teacher succeeds in making the students’ behaviours change from disruptive to positive behaviours through the important part of the teacher’s roles in selecting and managing various activities in the classroom.",
