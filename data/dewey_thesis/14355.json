  "title": "A Study of the influence of the main character's psycological condition and the fearful circumtances toward the main characters in \" the fall of the house of user\" and \" the pit and the pendulum\"",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of Edgar Allan Poe's masterpiece short stories, \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" and \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" In this study, I pay attention to how the psychological condition of the characters and the settings in \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" and \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" influence each other as the major problem of the analysis. In this thesis, I want to reveal that the psychological condition of the characters and the settings really influence each other. I use the theory of characterization and setting to analyze the psychological condition of the characters and the setting. In the analyzing I know that mental condition of the characters is influenced by the fearful circumstances and this makes their mental disorder worse; besides, the mental disorder can make the fearful circumstances more fearful. I can conclude that the psychological problems of the characters and the fearful setting really influence each other.",
