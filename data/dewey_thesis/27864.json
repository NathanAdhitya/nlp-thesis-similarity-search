  "title": "The Compliment responses used by herbalifes male and female customers in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "This thesis mainly deals with the males’ and females’ compliment responses from Herbalife following up system. The focus of my analysis is the types of males’ and females’ compliment responses that occurred the most frequent by both genders, the differences or/and similarities of males’ and females’ compliment responses types. To analyze the data, I used Holmes’ (1995 & 2006) and Wolfson’s (1989) theories. I used Lesmana’s (2009) and Rosemarie’s research (1997) as well for the contrast between an online communication research and an offline communication research. For the methods, I used a descriptive qualitative approach supported by quantitative data in developing my research.Then, from my analysis, I found out that both male and female interlocutors tended to accept the compliments given from female complimenter. Here, close relationship might have played an important role because the fifteen male and female interlocutors tended to accept the compliments given that were sent directly. Accordingly, direct communication especially this Herbalife research brings new findings which in common, men tend to reject the ability compliment while in this research I found out men mostly accept the compliment.",
