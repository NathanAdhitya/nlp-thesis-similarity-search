  "abstract": "Culture and national identity must be preserved by the younger generation, but over the time, the younger generation in Maluku is no longer interested in it. This is because culture is no longer a hot topic in everyday conversation, and social media is not used properly to share information about the Maluku culture. The purpose of this regional promotion design is to re-elevate the identity and preservation of Maluku as a cultural treasure in a modern way that is relevant for today's young generation. Through this design, the author hopes that the young generation of Maluku will take interest and love the culture and way of life of Maluku people as well as participate in preserving it, so that they will no longer forget their origins.",
