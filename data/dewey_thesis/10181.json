  "title": "The cultural generation differences in Narinder Dhami's Bend It Like Beckham",
  "abstract": "Bend it Like Beckham is a novel by Narinder Dhami. It is narrated in the first person by the main character, Jessminder Bhamra. She is an Indian immigrant born in the United Kingdom. The focus of this thesis is on the different perspectives on lifestyle, education, job, marriage and the role of women of Jess and her parents (as the first and second immigrant generations). This thesis focuses on the differences perspective between Jess and her parents and how they made the compromises to achieve a happy solution. The study uses the literary approach using the theories of conflict and characterisation. This study concludes that although there are huge differences and potential conflicts between Jess and her parents (due to the cultural and generational gap), they are able to make successful compromises.",
