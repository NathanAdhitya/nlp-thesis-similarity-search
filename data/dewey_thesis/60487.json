  "title": "The formation of perceived meaning on essential matters in The Little Prince",
  "abstract": "This study analyzes the correlation of social interactions and their role in forming the Aviator’s and the Little Prince’s perceived meanings of the essentials in life in The Little Prince. Using Blumer’s Symbolic Interactionism Theory, I analyze the processes during one’s social interactions, the meanings generated, the interpretation of meaning, and how it directs one’s actions. My analysis reveals their social interactions before the encounter generate perceived meanings on essential matters, which drive their lives. The Aviator, perceiving the essentials from interactions with industrialized society, lives a mundane and lonely life—whilst the Little Prince, perceiving the essentials come from the heart, lives a fulfilled life. However, their encounter alters the Aviator’s perceived meaning, creating a shared perceived meaning on essential matters. Ultimately, the shared perceived meaning drives their actions—the Aviator shares it with the readers and the Little Prince develops the way he expresses it with his friends.",
