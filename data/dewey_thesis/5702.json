  "title": "A Study of the efforts of Joe Keller to reach wealth and the effects of his efforts in Arthur Miller's all my sons",
  "abstract": "This study deals with the efforts of Joe Keller as the main character to reach wealth and the effects of his efforts in Arthur Miller?s All My Sons. I am curious to know about the efforts and also the effects of those main character?s efforts in reaching wealth. I use American dream concept to analyze Joe?s efforts; those are included doing dirty business, lying, and sacrificing others. In doing this research, I use literary approach. I also use library research supported with internet sources. From the data that I have collected, I use it in my analysis of the efforts and effects. I relate American dream concept with the efforts and the effects in my analysis. Through this analysis, I found that the main character?s efforts and their effects are basically related with American dream concept. The efforts may occur in everyone?s life. The wealth will mean nothing although it is already achieved if we also lose something important in our life. When someone cannot choose good ways on reaching wealth, they get it wrong in understanding the American dream.",
