  "title": "The Language styles based on the sentence structure and meaning of Antony's oration in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar",
  "abstract": "Style, as an important aspect in human language, influences the clarity of the conveyed messages. The writer is interested in studying language styles due to their roles in effective communication. The writer chose Antony?s oration in Shakespeare?s Julius Caesar concerning its eloquence that makes the Romans change their opinion about Caesar. She wants to find the effectiveness of certain language styles used in a persuasive speech, i.e. those based on Sentence Structure and Meaning. The theories used are the theory of stylistics, Keraf?s classifications of language styles based on Sentence Structure and Meaning, and the theory of persuasive speech. The writer used qualitative and quantitative approaches because the data were in the form of words and she looked for the tendency of the proportion of the occurring language styles. Finally, the writer found that Parallelism, Alliteration, and Irony are three language styles that appear the most frequently in Antony?s speech and contribute greatly to the strong persuasiveness of the speech. Parallelism and Alliteration contribute to the rhythm of expression that makes the speech more memorable, while Irony helps to influence the Romans? conscience to change their opinions towards Caesar and turn against Brutus.",
