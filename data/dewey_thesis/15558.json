  "title": "A Study of guilt in Miller's the crucible",
  "abstract": "This thesis is about the play of Arthur Miller, The Crucible, a drama of the features of the Puritans who lived in the seventeenth century in Salem, Massachusetts. The writer here is attracted to analyze the guilty feeling of four characters, John Proctor, Elizabeth Proctor, Reverend Parris, and Reverend Hale and the communal guilt of Reverend Parris and Reverend Hale as the representatives of the Puritan society. Aside from applying the theory of characterization, the writer also takes the psychological theory of guilty feeling to analyze their reasons of having such feelings. From the analysis, it is found out that their guilty feelings arise because of transgressing God's laws. And through the analysis of the characters' guilt, the writer figures out that Reverend Parris and Reverend Hale, as the representatives of the society, find themselves have communal guilt since they have to act according to the will of the society in transgressing God's laws in Salem.",
