  "abstract": "Chick Lit book usually focus on how the main character finally finds her true love after several times meeting the wrong guy. However, through the issues of marriage that I make for my creative work, I am stressing more on their psychological emotional maturity before they finally decide to get married. The story talks about a woman who has a boyfriend but not yet ready to marry him. She captured in her own insecurities about being a wife and her situation only gets worse when she rejected the proposal and her family found out. The story will revolve around the emotional journey from the problem that keeps coming to her life and slowly reveals the changing behavior and her ways of thinking. With the idea of ideal age for marriage and psychological emotional maturity as the main topic, this work will hopefully remind people to look the idea of how important it is to see that marriage is not about age but more about their psychological emotional maturity. To further understand how psychological emotional maturity works in my character, there are emotional levels of maturity that is used as the main theory in this work. The story presented through the genre of Women’s fiction specifically in ChickLit, as this genre and its conventions suit the style of this creative work which focuses on women and the journey of the character",
