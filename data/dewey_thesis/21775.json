  "abstract": "In this research I am interested in investigating politeness strategies used by male and female mentors to their tutors of Ethics Tutorial Class of Petra Christian University in Kelompok Tumbuh Bersama or KTB. I choose the male and female mentors because they have different strategies of politeness strategies in the way they communicate with the tutors. Thus, I want to find out the strategies used by male and female mentors in using politeness strategies by using Brown and Levinson?s theory (1987). I also want to find the differences and similarities of politeness strategies used by the male and female mentors in their utterances. I used qualitative approach supported by quantitative data in order to analyze the strategies used by male and female mentors. The result showed that the frequencies of the use of politeness strategies occurred more in female mentors. Female mentors used more both positive and negative politeness strategies than male mentors. It shows that sex differences influence the way of using the politeness strategies.",
