  "title": "Youth register in the Lizzie Mcguire movie",
  "abstract": "When people talk to others who have the same jobs, environment, or activities, they will use the same register. Register can be described as the language of groups of people with common interests or jobs, or the language used in situations associated with such groups. Thus, when young people talk to young people, they will use the same register which is called youth register. This is a study that focused on finding out the characteristics of youth register used in The Lizzie McGuire Movie. This research is based on Holmes?s (1992) theory about the characteristics of register. The result of this study indicates that the characteristics of register which are used in The Lizzie McGuire Movie are particular vocabularies, syntactic inversion, syntactic reduction, heavy noun modification characteristics. The only characteristic which is not used is routines and formulas characteristic. Among all of the characteristics of youth register, particular vocabularies characteristic is the most often used characteristic.",
