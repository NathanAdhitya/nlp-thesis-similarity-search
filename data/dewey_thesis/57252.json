  "title": "Persuasive strategies used by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in their campaign speeches",
  "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the persuasive strategies employed by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in their campaign speeches, guided by the theoretical framework proposed by Beebe and Beebe (2012). Through qualitative analysis of paragraphs extracted from two campaign speech transcripts, the study identifies the distinct persuasive strategies of each speaker. Joe Biden used causal reasoning, specific evidence, evidence to tell a story, concrete examples, emotion-arousing words, metaphors and similes, fear appeals, appeal to emotions of hope, appeal to emotions of courage, and shared myths. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, used deductive reasoning, specific evidence, evidence to tell a story, concrete examples, emotion-arousing words, fear appeals, appeal to emotions of hope, and appeal to emotions of courage. The writer also found that gender did not significantly influence the persuasive strategies of Biden and Harris. Instead, the study suggests that various factors such as the speaker's background and the specific context of the speeches, may have a more profound impact on their choice of persuasive techniques.",
