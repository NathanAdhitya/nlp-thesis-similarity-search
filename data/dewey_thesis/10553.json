  "title": "The Request strategies used by male and female students of Petra Christian University to their father",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to identify the differences and similarities of the request strategies used by twenty Chinese Indonesian male and twenty Chinese Indonesian female students of Petra Christian University in requesting some money from their father. There were four main theories that are used in this study: The Request theory by Searle (1976), The Request Strategies by Blum-Kulka (1989), Social Distance by Holmes (2001), and Gender by Holmes (1992). The writer found that the Chinese Indonesian male students preferred Indirect Request as their expression to ask some money to their father and the Chinese Indonesian female students preferred Direct Request as the head act. The writer also found that the male students not always show their request directly as our thinking and the female students can show their request directly because of some factor like social distance and gender.",
