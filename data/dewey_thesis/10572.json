  "abstract": "This thesis deals with the adjacency pairs and disjointed adjacency pairs. In this research, the writer wanted to know what adjacency pairs and disjointed adjacency pairs occured in \"Finding Nemo\". The writer used Adjacency Pairs theory explained by Sacks (1967) and Speech Acts theory explained by Austin and Searle as supporting theory. The writer took the conversation between Marlin and Dory in Finding Nemo?s script. The writer divided the adjacency pairs into two parts, that is, the well-responded adjacency pairs and not well-responded (disjointed) adjacency pairs. Because the writer only analyzed the disjointed adjacency pairs, she found out that there are some reasons from Dory for her not-well response (disjointed) action toward the first pair, like short term memory loss, stubbornness. Also, there are some reasons for Marlin not to respond well, like negative thinking, focuses on other thing. The writer concluded that disjointed adjacency pairs are still acceptable as long as it can be understand.",
