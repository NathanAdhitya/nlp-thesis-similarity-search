  "title": "Skyrim as a representation of the American Dominant Culture",
  "abstract": "This thesis aims to give pictures of the American values inside an American cultural product, Bethesda’s the Elder Scroll V: Skyrim. Bethesda’s the Elder Scroll V: Skyrim displays a journey of no body becoming a savior of the world. I am going to analyze the values inside this video games using the ideology approach and traditional American values. I will use the ideology as the concept that cultural products contain ideologies or values of the dominant group. The traditional American values will serve as the standard values of the American dominant group. Furthermore, I will discuss whether the traditional American values in the video game are the same or somehow shifting. In conclusion, I find out that the Elder Scroll V: Skyrim has all of the American traditional values. There are also some shifting American values inside the video game due to the medieval theme. Thus, the Elder Scroll V: Skyrim does represent the American society and how it should be.",
