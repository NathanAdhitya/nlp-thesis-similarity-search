  "title": "A Study on the loyalty and devotion of Giles Winterborne and their effects on Grace Melbury in Thomas Hardy's the woodlanders",
  "abstract": "Loyalty and devotion become substantial since they are the underlying problem in this novel of romance. This thesis is primarily composed to perceive Giles Winterborne as the principal character who upholds his loyalty and devotion until death becomes him. The writer would like to discuss Gileses reasons of loyalty and devotion, and how the loyalty and devotion are revealed. Besides, she studies their effects upon the woman Giles is fond of. To accomplish the objective goal of the thesis, the writer will use characterization, conflict, and setting as the literary tools. In the analysis, it is revealed that Giles has some reasons to maintain his loyalty and devotion. He also applies certain ways to present them. Then, Giles's loyalty and devotion convey some effects toward Grace Melbury. At last, through the analysis, the writer ultimately reaches a conclusion that the main reason of Giles Winterborne's loyalty and devotion is his blind love toward his ex-fiancee, Grace Melbury. This sightless love is also the cause that triggers him to his death.",
