  "abstract": "In this research, the writer observed the five non-existing Indonesian sounds in Dutch sound system that pose a problem, and the phonological errors produced by the Dutch exchange students. The data were taken from recording data. The main theories used were the consonant produced in Indonesian from Moeliono and Darwowidjojo (2003) and Dutch from Mennen, Levelt and Gerrits (2006). By comparing the consonant theories produced in Indonesian and Dutch, the writer found five Indonesian sounds that do not exist in Dutch sound system. The findings show that Dutch exchange students produced errors in initial, medial and final positions especially for [c], [?], and [] sounds. However, for the pronunciation of [w], there was no errors produced by Dutch exchange students in the final position. In addition for [], there was no error in the final position since there is no Indonesian words end with [] in final position. Besides that, the errors mostly occurred in the student?s pronunciation of [?] and []. In addition, there were thirteen deviations that occurred from the observed sounds. In conclusion, the Dutch exchange students produced errors from five observed sounds due to the transfer from first language rule and lack of knowledge of Indonesian consonants.",
