  "abstract": "In The Family Reunion and The Elder Statesman.T.S. Eliot employs different ghosts.In The Family Reunion, the ghosts appear as characters called Eumenides,loving Greek ghosts whose guidance prove to be effective for Harry when he faces a dilemma for choosing either staying or moving from Wishwood.Meanwhile,in The Elder Statesman,Eliot presents two \"ghosts\"from Claverton's past that haunt Claverton and whose terror effectively make Claverton confront a hesitancy,to confess his past sins or to keep them hidden inside his heart.By analysing Harry's and Claverton's characterization and their conflicts,the thesis writer proves in this thesis that the ghosts in the two plays have the significance as powerful means to reveal the theme of self-realization to Harry and Claverton.The ghosts bring Harry and Claverton to the realization of their lives so that they realize their mistakes and are released from their guilty feeling that so far haunt them and make them suffer. Finally,both Harry and Claverton get happiness and peace in their hearts.Above all,the appearance of the ghosts show their prominent roles in these dramatic works.",
