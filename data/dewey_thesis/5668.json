  "title": "A Study of Indonesian-Korean code-mixing produced by Korean women in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "This thesis is about the code-mixing used by Korean women who live in Surabaya. Korean women in Surabaya spoke to Indonesian people in Indonesian language mixed with Korean codes. Code-mixing is a linguistic phenomenon, which people often use in a multilingual society. The writer wants to find out what Indonesian-Korean code-mixing structural elements Korean women produce and what Indonesian-Korean code-mixing structural element is the most frequently used in conversation. The theories of this research are code, code-mixing and parts of speech. The writer observes 10 Korean women and 4 utterances for each person. The writer finds data from the natural conversation between Korean women and Indonesian people. Korean women use adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, interjections, particles, pronouns, word endings, and verbs. The most frequently used part of speech is particles. Korean women use particles in conversation with Indonesian people because of the lack of knowledge about Indonesian language, the differences of Indonesian and Korean structure, and language habits of Korean people. It is difficult for Korean women to change or to correct the language habits.",
