  "title": "The use of third-party voluntary certification in helping Nestle eliminating child labour in its cocoa supply chain",
  "abstract": "Child labour is one of the many social issues that gained attention from the public. Many organizations and companies are demanded to be more socially aware in their supply chain through the published Sustainable Development Goals by United Nations, including the cocoa industry where child labour has been a problem for many years. Among them is Nestle. However, recently non-governmental organizations also paid attention to child labour and have published their agendas in the form of independent certification systems. Therefore, this study aims to assess whether these third-party voluntary certification initiatives do help Nestle in their effort to eradicate child labour in their cocoa supply chain. Literature review and desk research are used to obtain data, process and interpret it into useful information. The finding shows that third-party voluntary certifications cannot help Nestle in eliminating child workers from cocoa production, but possibly could reduce the number of child labour. At the end of this study, the author suggests a customized collaboration between Nestle and the non-governmental organizations to maximize benefits of certification schemes as well as mentions the limitations of this research and implications for future studies.",
