  "title": "A Study on the effects of Georgina's failure in love and her way to escape from the reality in Elmer Rice's dream girl",
  "abstract": "Elmer Rice?s play Dream Girl reveals the condition of woman who experiences failure in love. The main character in this play, Georgina, is described as a woman who has problems in her love life. Georgina falls in love with her brother-in-law. Thus, her failure influences her life that turn to her inner conflict. Therefore, in this study, I want to analyze the effects of her failure in love and fantasy becomes her way to escape from the reality. By employing characterization and conflict as the literary tools, I may recognize Georgina?s personalities and her inner conflicts. Also, by using other theory such as the concept of fantasy, I would relate them to Georgina?s fantasy as her way to escape. From the analysis, I find out that Georgina?s failure in love gives effects to her life, they are: she lacks appreciating in life, becoming negative thinking about life, having emotional problem, fear of loving, making her distrust of love to the men, and having no concentration in her career. . Then, she tries to escape by using fantasy. She often elaborates daydream which is in contradiction with the reality. By using fantasy, she gets temporary satisfaction in seeking solution. It means that she uses her fantasy as her way to escape from the reality. Instead, she is involved in her own fantasy.",
