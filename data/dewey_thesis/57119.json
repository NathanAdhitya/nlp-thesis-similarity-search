  "title": "Question types and cognitive domains in an English teacher's classroom discourse at Petra Language Center",
  "abstract": "This study aims to find the types of questions and cognitive domains employed by an English teacher to primary students in the Children 3B English class at Petra Language Center. The theoretical frameworks guiding this research are Wragg and Brown's (2001) types of questions and Anderson and Krathwohl's (2001) cognitive domains, supported by the WH question theories, both English (Larsen-Freeman & Celce-Murcia, 2016) and Indonesian (Moeliono et al., 2017). Employing a qualitative approach, the writer transcribed and analyzed the teacher's WH questions in both Indonesian and English during three meetings before the final exams. The analysis showed the teacher used two of three types of questions: conceptual and empirical questions. The teacher also utilized two of six cognitive domains: remember and understand. The English teacher primarily employed conceptual questions and remember cognitive domain. In conclusion, noteworthy factors that may have influenced the outcomes include the materials, the learning focuses, the learning objectives, and the students' proficiency level. Future research should extend to the Teenager class at Petra Language Center to examine the teacher's response to students' answers to the teacherâ€™s questions.",
