  "abstract": "This qualitative study aimed to know the teacher's and the students' perspectives on implementing ten Extensive Reading principles by Day and Bamford (2002). The study also tried to draw the similarities and differences between teachers' and students' perspectives. The research subjects were ten students and one teacher from the Extensive Reading and Writing class in the English Department of Petra Christian University, Surabaya. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore their perspectives toward implementing ten principles of Extensive Reading. The findings showed that the teacher and the students shared similarities and attitudes toward implementing ten principles of Extensive Reading (ER). In conclusion, both thought that ER positively impacted the students' language skills (speaking, writing, and reading). However, they shared different perspectives on 7 out of 10 principles of Extensive Reading. Also, some tenets appear to be violated due to a lack of understanding of ER and the Extensive Reading and Writing class's unique nature. For future research, the writer suggested doing quantitative analysis with various subjects so that the research results could be more generalization.",
