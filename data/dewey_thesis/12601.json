  "title": "A Study of love as seen in Amy Dorrit in Charles Dickens' little Dorrit",
  "abstract": "One of the aspects that is seen in Charles Dickens' Little Dorri t is love which is seen in the character of Amy Dorrit. Her love is mostly seen through her care and affection for her family, Arthur Clennam and his mother. The latter is a touching and wonderful one for she can show her love to Arthur and Mrs.Clennam, eventhough she knows that Arthur does not love her and Mrs.Clennam hates her. It. arouses the question in the thesis writer's mind whether her love to them is only to gain Arthur's sympathy, the one whom she loves and admires, or whether it is really a sincere love. The analysis, then, is focused on the re-demption of Arthur and Mrs. Clennam by Amy's love. In this case, the thesis writer analyzes what the main character, Amy Dorrit, does and says to Arthur and Mrs.Clennam. From Arthur and Mrs .Clennam' s redemption, it can be seen clearly that Amy's attitude is really based on love. Amy offers her love to them eventhough Arthur does not love her and Mrs. Clennam hates her. With her love and gentleness, Arthur can regain his spirit of life and Mrs. Clennam becomes a humble woman. Thus Amy's love is eros because of her romantic love to Arthur. Her love is also agape for her love is patient, kind, tender, merciful, and she never asks to be paid back.",
