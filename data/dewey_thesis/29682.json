  "abstract": "In general, this thesis was an analysis of negative syntactic patterns used by all the black characters in Gina Prince-Bythewood’s film Love and Basketball. Since the writer found some difficulties to understand the language of the film which used Black English besides Standard English, she was interested to find out the negative syntactic patterns iised by all the black characters. The writer used qualitative research to gather all negative utterances produced by all the black characters as the data. As for the data analysis, the writer applied the underlying theories that were Baker’s and Francis’ theories of negative sentence of Standard English and supported by Labov’s theory of Black English negative patterns. The Writer then classified and analyzed the data to get the negative syntactic patterns used by all the black characters in this film. The Writer finally found that negative syntactic patterns of Black English which consisted of negative with “ain’f ’ and double negative actually existed in this film; however, the use of negative syntactic patterns of Standard English was most dominantly in the film. Thus, it could be said that the black characters used the negative syntactic patterns of Standard English more dominantly than those of Black English.",
