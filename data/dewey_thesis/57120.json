  "abstract": "This study analyzes the website localization and the translation technique of the localization of Dove Indonesia’s website that includes the home page and its first next link. The writer uses the theory of website localization by Pym (2012) and translation technique by Molina and Albir (2002). This study uses a qualitative method. This result of the study found that the website is highly localized with adaptation and translation. Adaptation includes change in data and time format, legal inventions, and content. The content includes change in campaign or movement, keyword, and main text body. The translation itself uses single and duplet translation techniques. Single technique includes amplification, borrowing, compensation, discursive creation, generalization, literal translation, modulation, particularization, reduction, and transposition. Duplet technique includes compensation and borrowing and reduction and amplification. However, the mostly used translation technique is a single technique, literal translation.",
