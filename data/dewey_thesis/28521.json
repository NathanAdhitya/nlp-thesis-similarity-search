  "abstract": "This thesis deals with the types of complaint strategies used by male and female in a film entitled The Miracle Worker, and also the differences and similarities in the use of complaint strategies. The writer used the theory of complaint by Trosborg (1995) as the main theory to analyze the data she collected from the four characters in the film: Arthur Keller, James Keller, Kate Keller, and Anne Sullivan. The writer conducted this research in qualitative approach supported by quantitative data because it is easier to understand the result with an in-depth description and statistic of distribution of complaint strategies. The findings revealed that male main characters used seven out of eight strategies; meanwhile, the female main characters used four out of eight strategies. In using those strategies, female main characters are using strategies which are moving toward indirect style; meanwhile, the male main characters are using strategies which are moving toward direct style. Moreover, in terms of frequency, male main characters complained more frequently than female main characters. In conclusion, gender does not influence the use of complaint strategies types it is power that does.",
