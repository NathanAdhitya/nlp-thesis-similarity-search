  "title": "A study of quality-price ratios in value-for-money awards to enhance bid evaluation in PT X",
  "abstract": "The aim of the procurement process is to achieve the best utilization of resources and budget. A contract is awarded to the bidder that brought the most economically advantageous offerings, evaluated by scoring that is performed equally in comparison of all bidders. Because the procurer has less flexibility to choose any other bidder than the one that obtained the highest score, it is crucial to utilize a well-designed method for bidding evaluation. This paper provides an objective method for determining a bidâ€™s quality-price ratio, which is quality divided by price, for the purpose of value-for-money awards. Most procurement methods now first convert prices into points, making them less objective and producing no ratios. To match the proposed scoring to the relative weight of the price criteria, all bids begin with a predetermined quality score, then compete for the remaining variance of quality points up to the maximum. It is then resulting in the same rank as the current method evaluation, in a more direct approach.",
