  "abstract": "In this study, the purpose was to find out difficulties, solutions, and strategies in translating poems by doing an annotated translation. The subject of this study was the book entitled Canvas by Beni Wego. The writer only analysed twenty-one poems based on the theme. The strategies that the writer used were four strategies by Lefevere (1975), six strategies by Baker (2018) and two strategies by Newmark (1988). Then, there were two most suitable strategies used which were translation by paraphrase using a related word and free translation. From the analysis, the writer had eighty-seven difficulties and they were solved by the strategies. The difficulties were dealing with two words that have similar meaning in the TL, words that are difficult to find the meaning in the TL, length of words, literal meaning & real meaning in the TL, non-equivalent words in the TL, words that have multiple meanings, words cannot be lexicalized, unimportant words, information, words that need more explanation, and idiom structure. From this study, it could be concluded that when doing annotated translation, the writer finally knew the process of her translation and easily found the difficulties and solutions by annotating them.",
