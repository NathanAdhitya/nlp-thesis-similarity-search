  "title": "The Request strategies that are used by husband and wife based on status in American Beauty film",
  "abstract": "In this research the writer is interested in investigating request strategies toward the main characters in American Beauty film. The writer chooses the characters which are husband and wife because they have different status. The wife has a better job, it makes the wife has more power than her husband. Thus, the writer wants to find out what request strategies they have made to each other by using Blum Kulka theory of request (1989). In describing the possible factors that influence the main characters in making requests, the writer uses descriptive quantitytive approach. The percentage results show that the husband mostly uses strong hint of non-conventionally indirect request strategies while the wife often uses mood derivable of direct requests. More power gives a person freedom in using direct request. It shows that social status may have influenced the speakers in making the requests.",
