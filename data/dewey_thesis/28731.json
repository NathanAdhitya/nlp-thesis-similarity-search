  "abstract": "This thesis aims to reveal the clash of value between April and Frank in their relationship in Richard Yates’ Revolutionary Road. I choose to discuss this novel because I am interested in one of the heroines, April Wheeler, who has different values from her husband, Frank. I am interested to discuss why April and Frank have a clash of values in their relationship as husband and wife. The purpose of the analysis is to reveal the main factor that creates the clash of values between them which affects their relationship as husband and wife. Moreover, the concept of gender role, power and motherhood are applied to understand the value which is held by the main characters. The analysis shows that there are differences of values between April and Frank. They have different values in terms of job and having an ideal spouse. April’s value as an independent woman is clashed with Frank’s value as the breadwinner of the family. Therefore, both of them have their own value and it makes them unable to fulfill their partner’s expectation. In the end, it can be concluded that value plays important part to control someone’s",
