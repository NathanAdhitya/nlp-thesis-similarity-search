  "title": "Speech acts on the miscommunication between Agus and Rita in Aditya Mulya's Jomblo",
  "abstract": "Basically, this is a research on the miscommunication that took conversations between Agus and Rita in Aditya Mulya?s novel entitled Jomblo as its data to be analyzed. Here, the writer chose Speech Act theories, especially the illocution and the perlocution theories, as the main theories. She addopted theories or statements from Austin, Searle, Hurford and Heasley, and many other linguists who discuss about the illocution and the perlocution. Moreover, she also used men?s and women?s language theory from Holmes, Gray and Lakoff. In this research, the writer intended to reveal the illocution and the perlocution used by Agus and Rita, which can trigger conflict and occur within the conflict itself. As the conclusion, she finally found, it is true that when the hearer?s illocution does not conform the speaker?s perlocution it will cause miscommunication as well. She found various kinds of illocution which can trigger and appear within the conflict. She also found the characteristics of Agus and Rita.",
