  "title": "Discrimination, stigma and benefits of being single: a study of two Surabayanese single women",
  "abstract": "This qualitative research is aimed to find out the discrimination, stigma as well as benefits of being single for the two Surabayanese single women. Research questions include: (1) What is the discrimination experienced by the two Surabayanese single women? (2) What is the stigma experienced by the two Surabayanese single women? (3) What are the benefits of being single according to the two Surabayanese single women? In order to find out the answers of my research questions, I asked two Surabayanese single women, one with married sibling and one with unmarried sibling to be my informants. I used both qualitative approach and phenomenological approach, which combined semi structured interview and open-ended interview to find out the discrimination, stigma and benefits of being single experienced by the two Surabayanese single women. To analyze the findings, I used thematic content analysis and narrative inquiry. The findings of my study showed all of my informants experienced discrimination and stigma related to their status of being single, which is also known as singlism (De Paulo & Morris, 2005). Apart from the discrimination and stigma, both of my informants also experience the benefits of being single.",
