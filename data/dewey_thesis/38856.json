  "title": "The Impact of advertising spending towards profitability and firm value in Indonesia banking industry",
  "abstract": "Banking sector in Indonesia can be considered as the biggest sector and have a high market capitalization. It is also considered as one of the most important industry in Indonesia. The current economic downturn has forced Banks in Indonesia to cut their expense to maximize profitability. One of the major expenses that are being cut is advertising spending. In this research, it is believed that advertising spending impacts towards firm value but its impact is mediated through profitability. This research has successfully collected data of Indonesia's top 10 Banks per 2015 which are listed at Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2009-2015. Those data are processed with linear regression and mediation analysis which proves that advertising spending has significant impact towards firm value which is mediated through profitability.",
