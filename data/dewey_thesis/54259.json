  "title": "From planning to automation: business intelligence at PT XYZ fintech",
  "abstract": "Fintech has grown significantly over the years, making financial services more advanced. Its impact on the digitalization era has enabled people to do transactions contactless. People no longer have to bring physical money or wallet whenever they want to do transactions. Its various features have benefited users and merchants in terms of money spent and gained back through the Fintech company’s strategy. To produce the best strategy, the internal management of one’s company analyzes its customers' and merchants’ payment transaction performance. To produce the best outcome, periodical reports are generated. Business intelligence utilizes tools such as SQL, Tableau, and Airflow to support the data requested by users across departments. In order to keep track of the products produced and keep up the efficiency, a team can implement an agile scrum methodology. It allows a team to be more adaptive and well- organized.",
