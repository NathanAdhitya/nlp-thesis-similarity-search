  "title": "A lean manufacturing analysis for waste reduction through value stream mapping in PT X",
  "abstract": "This study delves into Company X's production shortfall, investigating instances where actual output falls short of established targets. By comparing station-specific production targets with October's production data, inconsistencies emerged, primarily due to varied production capacities across stations. To comprehensively address this issue, the study utilizes value stream mapping (VSM) analysis, Ishikawa diagrams, waste assessment tools (including waste assessment questionnaires and waste relationship matrices), and Value Stream Analysis Tools (VALSAT). The analysis involves creating a comprehensive big-picture mapping of the production process flow, identifying activities at each station through a detailed process activity mapping. The study systematically explores root causes of production disruptions, including capacity variations. Inclusive of the analysis results, which shed light on the intricacies of the production challenges, actionable recommendations are proposed. One significant recommendation is the development of a revised PAM, as well as a standard work process using checklists specifically in the process of mixing and filling. This proposed standardization aims to streamline operations, reduce variability, and contribute to overall process improvement.",
