  "abstract": "This thesis paper carries character analysis study of the reasons of Emma?s problems for having love relationship in Jane Austen?s Emma. Emma?s character has taken an important role since she is the main character of the novel. She has a dynamic character and eventually changes through her faults toward others. She is used to matchmaking other persons while she herself seems not interested at all in love relationship. That is why I intend to analyze the reasons of Emma`s problems for having love relationship. Furthermore, since the approach is literary approach then I use the literary devices to analyze the novel, they are characterization and conflict. Through characters analysis, this study discovers that there are two major factors of Emma?s reasons for having problems in love relationship. They are the external factors of Emma?s problems for having love relationship that are her complicated position in her family and dependent father, and the internal factors that are Emma?s consequence in woman equal right, Emma?s inconsistency in her own feelings, and Emma?s snobbery.",
