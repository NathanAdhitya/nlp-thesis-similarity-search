  "abstract": "Business Intelligence (BI) is one of the fields in modern industry 4.0 as the field that is still somewhat new due to challenges that remain to this day to be overcome before businesses can use Business Intelligence tools optimally. Specifically, two important challenges to be addressed are memory management and data extraction. Memory allocation is a process of allocating various business projects in business intelligence (BI) tools so that these projects can run smoothly in the BI tools. The challenge that exists in memory management is that the RAM of computers is smaller when compared to the projects that must be worked on in BI tools. While it is possible to increase RAM size in computers, upgrading costs money and this practice is not friendly for startups with limited resources. Data extraction is a process of extracting raw data to gain the needed information within the raw data using a programming language. The challenge that exists in data extraction is that there are various methods to do data extraction and depending on the form the user wants the extracted data to be, some methods are more effective than others. Therefore, comparing methods is important to find the most effective method.",
