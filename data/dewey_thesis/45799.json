  "title": "The impact of service marketing mix (7ps) towards customers’ preference of KFC",
  "abstract": "Driven by the effect of globalization, fast food is now widely recognized. However, since the major players within the industry have a much more significant market share compared to the minor players, customers’ preference alongside the service marketing mix theory is believed to be one of the factors why such thing is happening. In analyzing the relationship between those two theories as well as their impact, this research focuses in Indonesia as a part of the Asia Pacific region, one of the most significant contributors to global fast food market, the other one being NorthAmerica. The leading case study uses KFC, which is the pioneer of Indonesian fast food market. In collecting the data, the convenience sampling technique was used and resulting in a total of 111 samples. This primary data was then analyzed using the multiple linear regression analysis. The result confirms that the service marketing mix simultaneously has a significant impact on customers’ preference for KFC. In contrast, the ones that individuals have a considerable impact are product, price, and process.",
