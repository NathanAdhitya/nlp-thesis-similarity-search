  "title": "A Study of the causes and the results of the cabalists' depression in Thornton Wilder's The Cabala",
  "abstract": "This study on Thornton Wilder's The Cabala is intended to analyze what the causes and the results of the Cabalists' depression are. From tlie discussion, it is revealed that tlie various failures, which are faced by Marcantonio, Alix and Astree-Luce, are the main causes of their depression. The failures which are faced by Marcantonio are tlie failure in getting rid of his bad habit and in becoming a successful athlete. Alix has the failure to be loved by her family and James Blair, while Astree-Luce's failure is to have a religious support. The inability to accept the failures arouses the feelings which make those Cabalists more depressed. Being haunted by the intense depression, finally they try to find solutions to rid tiiemselves from their depressed feelings. The ways that they choose are by doing actions which not only injure themselves but almost hurt other person as well. As a wa}' to overcome depression, Marcantonio chooses to kill himself while Alix also tries to commit suicide, and the other Cabalist, Astree-Luce, makes an attempt to murder the Cardinal Vaini. So, actually, the deeds that they have already done are the results of their depressed feeling.",
