  "title": "The roles of event organizer in arranging Chinese Indonesian wedding rituals",
  "abstract": "Nowadays, Chinese Indonesians have already been modernized and do not really know about their culture anymore. Therefore, they do not understand what they have to undergo on their wedding day. It becomes a good opportunity for event organizers (EO) to start their businesses. In this research, I am interested in finding out what are the roles of event organizers in arranging Chinese Indonesian wedding rituals. Therefore, this study focuses on the roles of EO in running their business and arranging Chinese wedding rituals to use the theory of consumerism. In consumerism, everything can be bought and sold, as long as there are demands from the customers, including culture. I did some interviews with some EO crews in Surabaya to find out the roles of EO in arranging Chinese Indonesian wedding rituals. In this research, I find that, in this modern society, culture is not considered as sacred anymore, and wedding rituals can be a commodity for EO to sell because there are demands from the customers. Thus, I conclude that even though in the old time's culture are considered sacred things, as time went by, culture also became a source of business, recently, as seen in the use of rituals in EO businesses.",
