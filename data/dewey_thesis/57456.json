  "title": "Impoliteness strategies used by white males and females toward the black staff in the hidden figures movie",
  "abstract": "This descriptive-qualitative research was done to find the types of impoliteness strategies used by the white characters in the Hidden Figures movie (Al Harisson, Paul Stafford, Vivian Mitchell, and Ruth), and how the recipient of impoliteness, Katherine Johnson (a black character), responded to it. The main theory used is Culpeper's (1996, 2003) impoliteness strategy and Bousfieldâ€™s (2008) responses to impoliteness. The findings reveal that not every impoliteness strategy is being produced by the characters. The one strategy that is not being produced is withhold politeness, because there are no such silent scenes in the movie. Besides withhold politeness, every type of impoliteness strategy is produced in the Hidden Figures movie. In addition, Katherine Johnson produces two types of responses to Al Harisson and Paul Stafford: accepting face attack and countering face attack. While responding to Vivian Mitchell and Ruth, Katherine Johnson only produces one type of response: accepting face attack. In conclusion, this research has examined how impoliteness and its responses are being produced in the Hidden Figures movie. In addition, the writer finds out that impoliteness could occur due to the gender and race factor.",
