  "title": "Sociocultural-interactive learning strategies employed by students of social science and engineering studies",
  "abstract": "The Aim of this study is to find how frequently employed are Sociocultural-Interactive (SCI) learning strategies by high-proficiency students of English for Academic Purposes at Petra Christian University in Surabaya, Indonesia. The study’s theoretical framework is from Oxford’s (2011) S2R Model. To know the frequency of employment of the strategies, the writer distributed a questionnaire to 33 students classified as high-proficiency students and divided them into two groups based on the fields of study: social science and engineering. Descriptive statistics were used to see which strategy is more frequently used by each group. Furthermore, to see if there is a significant statistical difference in employment of the strategies between the two groups, Independent T-Test was conducted. The findings suggested that although, in general, social science students used SCI strategies more frequently, there was no significant statistical difference between the two groups in regards to their employment of the SCI strategies. Additionally, the findings revealed that SCI strategies had not been maximally used in learning English.",
