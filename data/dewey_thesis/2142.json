  "title": "The Study of point of view in Wilkie Collins' the Woman in White",
  "abstract": "This thesis is an analysis of the use of the first person point of view in Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White. The Woman in White is a novel of mystery. The use of the first person point of view of more than one characters is suitable to reveal the mystery of the story. It is through Walter Hartright's point of view, Marian Halcombe's point of view, Vincent Gilmore's point of view, and Count Fosco's point of view. The narrators' interpretations on the story's actions are limited. For by using the first person point of view, they can tell only what they know and observe by themselves. They cannot report the thoughts and feelings of other characters for they cannot enter their minds. However these limitations have their advantages. The narrators' separate reports create a unity of the story. Their reports then reveal the story's mystery. Therefore the use of the first person point of view is effective for it can create the suspense and the tension of the novel.",
