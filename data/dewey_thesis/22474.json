The thesis writer uses literary approach, which is the theory of characterization to analyze Joan's character traits that influenced her conviction to God and theory of conflict to reveal Joan's death. In the analysis the thesis writer finds that Joan character traits that are persistence and ignorant play a big role in her way to be God's emissary; moreover, her character traits also give her courage to face all the consequences such as her death.
