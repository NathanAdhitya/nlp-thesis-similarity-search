  "title": "The impact of financial ratios towards the stock price of LQ-45 companies listed in the idx Period 2012-2014",
  "abstract": "Financial ratios are the most commonly used analysis tool as a measurement of a company’s financial condition. Investors and analysts often used financial ratios to gain quick insights about a company’s financial situation before investing in a company’s stocks, since economic rates are the measurement of the financial condition. In contrast, the stock price is the reflection of the financial health of the company. Investors and analyst used financial ratios to analyze companies inside an index in the IDX called the LQ – 45, which consists of companies with high trade volume and market capitalization. Therefore, this research aims to know the impact of financial ratios on the stock price of LQ – 45 companies listed in the IDX Period 2012 – 2014. This research would allow the writer, analysts, investors, and also companies to understand how significant the impact of financial ratios towards stock price is. The study was done by gathering data from 18 LQ – 45 companies consistently listed in the LQ – 45 index for three years by judgmental sampling and analyzed using multiple regression. The result shows that financial ratios simultaneously give a significant impact on the stock price. While individually, only liquidity ratio gives a considerable negative effect on the stock price.",
