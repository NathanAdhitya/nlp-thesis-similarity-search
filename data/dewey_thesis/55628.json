  "title": "Chinese Indonesian women in social media: representing the self through Instagram",
  "abstract": "This thesis is a study on the construction of Chinese Indonesian women’s identity through their self-representation in Instagram. This study aims to find the ways Chinese Indonesian women with different social backgrounds represent themselves in Instagram and know what aspects in the self-representations construct the women’s identity as Chinese Indonesian women. This study utilizes Stuart Hall’s theory of representation and Kress and van Leeuwen’s multimodal discourse analysis to answer the research questions. The data analysis taken from three informants shows that the consumption of ethnic symbols, religious symbols, and values from personal life experience affect the self-representation creation process. Ethnic and religious symbols, along with other visual and verbal elements, are combined with the women’s self\u0002portrait to create self-representations that construct their identities as caring towards the society, actively working in the public sphere, and respecting others with cultural differences. The self-representations are more oriented to generate a positive image for the women’s professional interests. On the other hand, there are no self-representations that primarily aim to declare the women’s identity as ethnic Chinese.",
