  "title": "A Comparative study between the existing stock control system with the new stock control system at Depot Kawanua to get the most efficient stock control system",
  "abstract": "Recently, many people open food stall almost everywhere in Indonesia, and become a trend. It is due to the belief that handling a food stall is easy and promises a bright future. However, managing a food stall is not as simple as people usually think. It is even more complicated when it deals with production process management. This happens because of many factors, and one of them is due to the inventory management system. In this paper, the writers try to present a method for identifying which inventories need close control and determine the best stock to hold. The writers hope that this paper may be beneficial to be implemented in the production process of the third store of Depot Kawanua that will be opened next year.",
