  "abstract": "This study is to find out (1) the types of maxims used by Chris Gardner in The Pursuit of Happiness movie, (2) types of maxim flouted by Chris Gardner and (3) the implicature that can be interpreted by the flouting of maxims. This study is a qualitative research. In order to answer the research questions, the writer used the theory on Cooperative Principle proposed by Grice (1975) stated in George Yule (2014). The source of the data was the film and the transcript, and the data were taken from Chris’ utterances showing the process of Chris’s success in pursuing his happiness in his life. The findings revealed that Chris mostly followed all the maxims. He mostly followed the maxim of manner and the least was maxim of quality. He also flouted the maxims in certain contexts. He mostly flouted the maxim of quality and the least was maxim of manner. From the flouting of the maxims, there was implicature that could be interpreted which was to create a good relation, to get a good chance, and to fulfill Chris’s will to be one employee in Dean Witter Reynolds-Resource Dept. which is the beginning of his success in his life. In conclusion, the flouting of the maxims was part of Chris’s effort in his life that gave contribution to his success, and it is proved through Chris’ utterances in the five chosen scenes.",
