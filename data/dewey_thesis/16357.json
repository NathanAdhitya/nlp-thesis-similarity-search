  "title": "Perencanaan dan pembuatan alat pengatur kecepatan motor DC seri 180 V, 0.5 HP, 1750 RPM dengan menggunakan bantuan motor stepper pada stavol 500 VA yang diatur malalui komputer",
  "abstract": "The application of DC motor usually uses in industry and transportation because they are easy to be control on speed and torque. The example of using DC motor in transportation is electric train. By giving DC electric voltage in directly will cause the speed of electric train shock suddenly because of that it needs speed control machine to control the speed automatically. The basic structure of this machine is base on the clip voltage control at the motor. By processing the voltage control by step will make the speed of the motor increase smoothly. The voltage change is control by the computer until the speed matches from we want. From the research, the motor speed can spin more smoothly.",
