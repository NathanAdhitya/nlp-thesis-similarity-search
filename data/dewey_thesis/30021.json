  "title": "Setting up an industrial control systems laboratory",
  "abstract": "With the evolution of Industrial Control Systems, many solutions from vendors are offered for industries. But sadly, most of those solutions are close-sourced, delivering lack of support for third parties who aims to develop Industrial Control Systems further. A start-up company named Security Matters needs an industrial instrument to simulate industrial environment to have a better idea how a particular protocol works The application made in this project was developed using Java programming language to have compatibility across platforms. An Object-Oriented-Programming and Model-View-Controller pattern are used as well to ensure maintainability. This application can be used to demonstrate capabilities of Mod-bus protocol and test industrial devices for vulnerabilities.",
