  "title": "An Analysis of a child maturation as seen through characterization in John Steinbeck's the red pony",
  "abstract": "People need to be mature if they want to be happy, or if they want to be productive and useful for other people. Maturity itself is a process as long as life itself. Someone has said that if we progress, we have advantages, and if we do not progress, just stop where we are, we lose. If we regress, we are chrushed. In this thesis, the writer writes about a child's maturition. His name is Jody and he has become mature through experiences. Jody is the main character in John Steinbeck's The Red Pony. The thesis writer would like to show that Jody learns that life is not always as we wish. In the process of learning difficult lessons Jody matures. He shows the fruit of maturity such as compassion, empathy and also caring for other people. Jody's development can not be separated from other characters and the influence they have on him. He learns character and valuable lessons from the people who surround him. All of these factors prepare Jody to face the harsh reality which he faces. It is interesting to know that some one can accept reality and produce the mature fruits of life from it such as caring, empathy and love.",
