  "title": "A Case study of arguments in letters of a Javanese Princess",
  "abstract": "Arguments have become an important part in our lives. A person may say that something is right, while another person say that it is wrong. Each person has his/her own supporting reasons. Kartini, who wanted to improve the lives of her people, especially of the women, also used arguments in order to reach her dreams. Because of the seclusion, she revealed her ideas, dreams and points of views through letters, which later were compiled by Mr. Abendanon in Door Duisternis Tot Licht. Through this thesis, the writer intends to make a case study of arguments of the English version of Kartini's letters - Letters of A Javanese Princess, translated by Agnes Louis Symmers. Kartini's letters are divided into 3 important periods and each period represents the changes in Kartini's way of thinking. Therefore, the writer has selected one letter from each period - letters which contain more arguments and which represent the ideas of each period that Kartini had undergone. The purpose of the study, then, is to see whether the relationship of reasons and the claim they are supposed to support can be logically accepted, or - as by Moore and Parker called - valid arguments.",
