  "abstract": "In this thesis, the object of this research is William Maugham's Of Human Bondage. The writer of this thesis is interested in the main character, Philip Carey, a physically handi- capped person, and wants to find out from his utterances 1. whether he is an inferior person; and 2 to which interlocutors he feels more inferior (those with power or solidarity). To answer the two questions, the witer uses two major approaches that is psychological and sociolinguistic. The psychological approach is used to obtain information on the criteria of an inferior person. While, the sociolinguistic approach is used to obtain information on social aspect of power and solidarity. The research finds that Philip, to some extent, is an inferi - or person,and he is more inferior to his inter - locutors who have higher status or power than he (Dr. South, Miss. Price, and Mr. Perkins).",
