  "abstract": "The arrival of Hickey always delights all inhabitants of Harry Hope?s saloon because they expect Hickey would give them free drink. However, this time, Hickey has given up drinking because he has found out the way to face the truth. He then urges everyone to do the same. Since Hickey, Larry, and Parritt are the main characters of the play, in this thesis, I am interested in revealing what their illusions are. Furthermore, I am interested to know the ways Hickey reveals the truth about himself, Larry, and Parritt. Finally, I am interested to know the results of the revelation of truth. In doing the analysis, I use literary approach and literary tools such as characterization, plot, and conflict. I analyze that each character has the illusions that they live with. Then the truth about Hickey, Larry, and Parritt are revealed and they have to live with the truth. I conclude that Hickey, Larry, and Parrit tend to see death as the only solution to each of their problem because they have lost their courage to go on living, so that it can be said that they are in the state of spiritual death.",
