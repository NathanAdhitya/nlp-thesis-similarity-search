  "title": "Providing visual aids (posters) for English lesson grade one in ABC Elementary School",
  "abstract": "This final project is based on the writerâ€™s internship in ABC Elementary School from March, 12th to June, 8th 2018. The writer thought that it was a good solution to make and provide posters as the final project because of a problem the writer found during her internship in ABC Elementary School. The writer created posters to help the students enrich their English vocabulary so that the students can follow the teaching-learning process. By having interesting posters with their uniqueness (3D poster, removable poster, and etcetera), the students are expected to feel more interested to know and learn English vocabulary. These posters can help to support the teaching-learning process.",
