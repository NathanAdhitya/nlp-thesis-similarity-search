  "title": "The Functions of quetions produced by Petra Christian University's male and female students",
  "abstract": "This thesis is aimed to understand more about the differences of male and female that makes them different in the way of talking, so that they can fix the communication between male and female. Next, it is intended to understand that question does not have only a function which is to seek information, but it has many other functions that may imply different purpose. The respondents of this thesis were 90 male and 90 female students of Petra Christian University. In collecting the data, the writer used role play based on the theory of question functions by Jennifer Coates (1996), which is important part of background knowledge to do the classification. Generally, this research was approached quantitatively. However, after analysis, the writer found that male students tend to use question to seek information. Whereas, female students used question in order to maintain the conversation and show solidarity. To conclude, the difference in producing question functions between male and female students is influenced by the different nature of the gender.",
