  "title": "Father-and-son's conflicts in Webtoon Bastard",
  "abstract": "Webtoon, a digital-comic media from South Korea, has become one of the popular entertainments in Indonesia and other countries. For this thesis, I will analyze a thriller Webtoon entitled Bastard, made by Carnby Kim and Youngchan Hwang. I am interested in Bastard because it has a great theme, plot, and drawing style, and it also receives good reviews from the readers. The story focuses on the conflicts between a father (Dongsoo Seon), who is also a murderer, and his son (Jin Seon), which inspires me to take the failure in the father-and-son’s relationship as my topic. Therefore, in this thesis I want to explore what factors trigger father-and-son’s conflicts and how those factors lead to the failure in the father-and-son’s relationship. In analyzing Bastard, I will apply the theory of father and son’s conflicts. I want to show the different ways of thinking from Dongsoo and Jin on concepts of happiness and love, parental roles, and parental authority can create conflicts because of no emotional bond and agreement related to familism values, discrepancy between expectations and reality, and no room for adolescent’s independence. In conclusion, the complexity in this father-and-son's relationship can attract Webtoon’s readers.",
