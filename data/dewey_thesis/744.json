  "abstract": "This study is conducted to reveal the use of compensatory strategies by the Tourism Students of Petra Christian University in English, particularly in solving lexical problems faced in story-retelling task. The basic theory used is the taxonomy of compensatory strategies by Nanda Poulisse which divides the compensatory strategies into conceptual and linguistic strategies, supported by the theory of speech production by Levelt and the related study by Violante Lujan Ortega. The approach of this study is qualitative-descriptive; meaning that the data consist of words instead of numbers, and the regularities found in the data are explained in detail. To gain the spoken data, the story-retelling task is chosen as the speech elicitation task; and the stories used are Indonesian folk tales, in accordance to the subjects' field of study. Finally the writer finds out that the most frequently used compensatory strategy is Holistic Conceptual Strategy, followed by Analytic Conceptual Strategy, and then Linguistic Strategy of Transfer, and the least frequent one is Linguistic Strategy of Morphological Creativity. She also discovers that the conceptual and linguistic strategies are sometimes interrelated, the subjects use language in economical ways, and several exceptions of the data.",
