  "title": "The Second language classroom modes by senior English teacher at XYZ English Course in Surabaya",
  "abstract": "This study is intended to find out the pedagogic goals, interactional features, and L2 classroom modes appeared in the fourth grade of elementary school students’ class. Conducting this study, I apply the theory of SETT (Self-Evaluation of Teacher Talk) framework proposed by Walsh (2006, 2011). The subject of this study was a senior teacher teaching general English to fourth grade of elementary school students. The data was collected through audio recorder for two meetings. The findings of this study showed that among 18 pedagogic goals, there were two goals that did not appear: to organize the physical learning environment and to provide LL with practice in sub-skills. The findings also showed that all of 14 interactional features appeared. This study found that in the interactive class recorded, all of four modes appeared, and managerial mode was the most frequent mode (54.54%). In conclusion, the teacher could make the class interactive because she allowed learners to formulate responses for seconds (extended wait-time) so that learners could contribute more (extended learner turn). Moreover, the teacher rarely completed learners’ contribution (teacher completion) and corrected learners’ mistakes directly (direct repair) so that the learners might feel confident to contribute in the activities.",
