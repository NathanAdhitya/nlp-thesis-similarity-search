  "title": "A Study of the main female character's process of self-realization in George Eliot's Daniel Deronda",
  "abstract": "The thesis deals with the process through which Gwendolen Harleth as the main female character in George Eliot's Daniel Deronda gains her self-realization. To know the development of Gwendolen's self-realization, the thesis writer analyzes her responses toward each of her inner conflicts, and also the influences of her social environment, represented by her mother, uncle, and Daniel Deronda. The writer uses library research to get the results of the whole study. Besides some literary criticism on the novel, the writer also uses the theory of self-blame, self-pity, self-acceptance, and self-realization, and some literary theories such as characterization, conflict, and setting. In short, the analysis is about Gwendolen's changing character traits and the development of her understanding toward herself. The study finds that the responses to the conflicts lead Gwendolen to her self-realization through the shattered feeling of superiority. The other findings are that in self-realization, there must be a balance between one's ideal and real-self, and a review of one's past life and other's guidance may lead the person to his or her self-realization.",
