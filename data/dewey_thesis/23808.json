  "title": "William Congreve's idea of true love as seen in love for love and the way of the world",
  "abstract": "The study on Congreve's Love for Love and The Wav of the World is intended to analyze the efforts of the characters , Valentine arid Angelica; Mirabell and Millamant to possess true love and happiness. It is only with their honesty, generosity and kindness can they obtain what they wish for. The male major characters in both plays are used to be libertines that they have many relationships with women and regard sexual relationships very lightly. They first use every artifice to gain what they want. However, after they find true love i the heroines, they can leave their libertinism to be generous men and find happiness. The artifices of the male characters to win their love are an education for them that tricks and dishonesty will not take them into happi- ness. Only after they can show their generosity and honesty, can they possess true love and find happiness. The true love they finally have is the kind of love that is not only affectation of love, but the real love that is very strongly rooted on them that can prevail all their problems. In addition to that, their kindness, generosity and honesty take the most important part in gaining their true love.",
