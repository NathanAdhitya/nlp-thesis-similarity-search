  "title": "The Acquisition of English interrogative of a six-year-old Chinese Indonesian boy",
  "abstract": "This study focuses on language acquisition of a Chinese Indonesian multilingual boy. I conducted a qualitative research to assess how his language has developed. Undoubtedly, he is able to understand three languages, English, Indonesian and Chinese, but English seems to be dominant than others. When I came to his house during pilot project, oftentimes he spoke English with others. He rarely used Indonesian, even I never heard him speaking Chinese. Therefore, after pilot project done, I decided to assess his development of English. There are at least two questions that I proposed. First, how his acquisition of English interrogative form has developed, second, what are the difficulties for him to make question in English. Therefore, to assess his acquisition of English interrogative form, I used Klima & Bellugi theory (1979) as cited by Hoff (2009, p. 239-240). After getting the data, in the form of questions produced by the boy, I concluded that the boy is at the third stage. This stage is a period when a child gets accustomed to use auxiliary and inversion. The second conclusion is that there were still some mistakes done by the boy in the area of vocabulary, tenses and inversion of embedded question.",
