  "title": "Model material handling system untuk dua rak berseberangan",
  "abstract": "Material Handling is one of the most important things to do in industrial workshop, considering that material handling plays a very important role in work efficiency. A good material handling will smoothen a work process in an industrial workshop, which will also increases work efficiency and affectivity. Based on the points above, a model of material handling system is made, with a specific purpose to handle material at two opposite racks. This mechanical model in material handling system for two opposite racks is controlled through a PC, where instructions are given. An input is given to move a material through cursor movement by pressing the mouse. The movement process will shown on PC monitor. Delphi 3.0 program is used to control the whole system using PPI Card 8255. The final test shows that this mechanical model in material handling system for two opposite racks is able to lift a load around 0.5 KG with a precision movement in any position.",
