  "title": "The Causes of Kostya's suicide in Anton Chekhov's The Seagull",
  "abstract": "Drama deals with emotion and intelligence. The complexities of this literary genre have encouraged me in choosing drama. From all kinds of drama that I have read, I decided to choose Anton Chekhov with his work The Seagull. The subjective reason why I chose his work is because it involves so many things without really having any action. It is a simple sketch of the events and dialogue of people?s lives, and yet the characters and their personalities are much more complex than what is spelled out in the play. This play talks much about social life which ordinarily happens with ordinary people who get involved in it. Furthermore, it discusses much about suicide which becomes my subject. In this thesis, I will analyze the reasons why Kostya commits suicide. Since this analysis will concern much with the causes of Kostya?s suicide, I decide to use literary approach with the literary devices of characterization and conflict.In my analysis, I find that the reason of Kostya?s suicide lies on loneliness which is influenced much by the conflicts he is unable to overcome. As a conclusion, people need support from other people to expand their social life. Poor social life and low selfacceptance can influence someone to commit suicide.",
