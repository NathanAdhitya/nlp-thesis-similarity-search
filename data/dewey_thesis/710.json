  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of some elements of feminism in Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd as reflected through Batsheba Everdene's character. The writer of this thesis is curious to find out some elements of feminism in this novel, and she is going to prove that there are some elements of feminism as reflected through the main female character's. In order to support the analysis of this thesis, the writer uses library research to find any related data including the ideal Victorian women, criticisms and feminist theories. She also uses a literary tool that is characterization, in order to have a better understanding of the main female character. She acts as though she were a \" male \" in the neighborhood. In other words, she tries hard to break the Victorian norms, in that she is welleducated, has a job as a manager of the large farm, she chooses her own husband, and she still has her authority in order to own the property after she gets married. Through the analysis of this thesis, the writer concludes that there are some elements of feminism reflected through Bathsheba Everdene's characters related to education, job or career and marriage.",
