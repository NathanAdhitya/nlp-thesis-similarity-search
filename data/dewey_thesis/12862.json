The thesis writer is interested to analyze maturity since there are not many people aware that maturity is very important in their life. That is why, people's personalities do not change. Through this thesis, the writer portrays how important maturity is in this life. Thus, the study of Edgar Allan Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym aims at analyzing the main character's maturity. Basically, he is a high-spirited youth who is very excited of a journey. For him, journey is an exciting adventure. He really wants to make the journey. Yet, his parents become his first problem in starting his dream. Pym's problem is not only related to his parents who disagree with his plan, Pym even gets other conflicts when he begins the journey. Thus, he realizes that a journey is hard. However, through the conflicts that he had, he changes. Pym understands about many things, since through his journey, he finds some conflicts which make him mature. Therefore, the writer uses theory of conflict and character. Besides, she uses psychology theory in order to get a clear definition about maturity. By this analysis, she wants to prove that a journey which is full of dangers can change a boy becomes mature.",
