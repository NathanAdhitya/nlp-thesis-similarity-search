  "title": "The Hesitations in William's utterances in his conversations with Anna in \"Notting Hill\"",
  "abstract": "In this thesis, the writer studies about how hesitations occur and influence a speaker?s utterances when he communicates and interacts in the conversation using turntaking and exchange strategies. The writer takes the data from the conversations between William and Anna in \"Notting Hill\" because the writer notices a lot of William?s utterances that contain hesitations. Beside that, through turntaking and exchange strategies that contain hesitations in William?s utterances, the writer analyses how he encourages himself to keep talking and communicating in the conversation. After analysing the data, the writer found that hesitations appeared as the consequences of William?s conditions when he felt confused, shy, panic, and nervous when he met Anna. In turntaking and exchange strategies, the writer found that William tried to handle his difficulty, motivate himself and carry out his role in order to keep talking with Anna. Thus, William could build good communication and relationship with Anna. Finally, the writer can conclude that hesitations may help the speaker build a good conversation, especially through managing him/herself, ideas, and strategy to run the conversation.",
