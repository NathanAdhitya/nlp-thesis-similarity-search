  "title": "Bank Mega: a study of customer experience on service marketing mix and its impact towards customer loyalty",
  "abstract": "With a lot of choices of bank in Indonesia, it is easy for the customers to switch banks when they see better products and services out there, and customer loyalty is in the risky situation. This research attempts to solve disloyalty issue of the customers in banking industry by analyzing the impact of customer experience on service marketing mix towards the customer loyalty, specifically in Bank Mega. The samples are Bank Megaâ€™s customers in Jabodetabek (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi) and Surabaya area. This research utilizes quantitative analysis with hypothesis testing research method. The result shows that customer experience in service marketing mix elements simultaneously affect customer loyalty. However, customer experience in place, people, and physical evidence individually do not affect customer loyalty significantly.",
