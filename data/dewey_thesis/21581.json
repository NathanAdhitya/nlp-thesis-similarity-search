  "abstract": "This thesis is a study of theme in \"A Happy Married Life\" and \"The Kreutzer Sonata\". Through these two short works, the author wants to convey the idea that man can live happily if he lives to love and to be loved. And man'5 life cannot be separated from God's love.Therefore, a married life should be based on real love relationship between husband and wife and a married life should be also based on God's love. This idea is revealed by the presentation of the main character's married life; Michailich and Masha. And if married life, is not based on real love, it cannot stand for any longer. This is revealed through Pozdnyshev's married life. At the end of the thesis, the writer concludes if man lives without lover, he may feel useless or lonely. Therefore, man should be married. It is not good that man lives alone. I will make a woman for him (Genesis 2:8).",
