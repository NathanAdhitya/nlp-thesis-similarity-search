  "title": "Design of performance monitoring and evaluation system in clay-making departments at PT Doulton Indonesia",
  "abstract": "PT Doulton is a leading company in premium ceramic tablewares manufacturing. Has been operating for more than four hundred years, PTD faces many competitors that has the same business. Because of the tight competition, the company is challenged to do continous improvement in order to fulfill customer expectations. In doing continous improvements, a good monitoring and evaluation system is needed because results of monitoring and evaluation can provide informations for the company in determining actions for improvements. Clay-Making Departments are departments in PT Doulton, which formed and shaped the wares. But, there are problems in monitoring and evaluation in these departments. Monitoring is done only when the production is over and it can not show whether a proccess is running well or not. Evaluation only focused on quality aspect. As the result, continous improvements in other aspects can not be done because there is no information about them. Through this thesis, a performance monitoring and evaluation system is designed. The monitoring system uses Production Board, Downtime Board, and Downtime&Making Report. The evaluation system is designed using Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).",
