  "title": "The Change of diction in the language spoken by Eliza in Bernard shaw's pygmalion",
  "abstract": "The writer uses George Bernard Shaw?s Pygmalion as the object of her study in this thesis. George Bernard Shaw was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1926 and Pygmalion is one of his most popular plays. In this play, he showed that accent and speech provides a way to social advancement. The writer finds that at the beginning of the play the major character, Eliza Doolittle, often uses non-appropriate words as the diction of her language use. Then, by reforming the choice of words (diction) of Eliza, Professor Higgins, transformed Eliza into a lady and her language especially her choice of words show the change at the end of the play. This fact attracts the attention of the writer to find out what kinds of changes occur in Eliza?s choice of words and to analyze what factors influence the change of her diction. In carrying out her study, she uses Mc Crimmon?s theory of diction as the main theory and Dell Hyme?s Ethnography of Communication as the supporting theory. This study is conducted through content analysis. The data for the analysis covers the diction which is used by Eliza Doolittle in the play. Then the Writer analyzes the diction especially on the appropriateness act by act and compares them later to determine the factors that causes of the changes of diction in the language spoken by Eliza.",
