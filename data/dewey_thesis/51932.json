  "abstract": "Although The Adventures of Tintin are dedicated to children, they still contain political and cultural issues. This study examines the transformations of The Adventures of Tintin TV series adaptation (1991-2) by Stéphane Bernasconi entitled Tintin in America, The Blue Lotus, Cigars of the Pharaoh, and The Broken Ear from similar titles of comic books by Hergé (1931-7). Qualitative methods are used to analyze the data using the theoretical framework of Orientalism by Edward Said, Counter-Orientalism by Donald Clarke, and the theory of Adaptation by Linda Hutcheon to reveal the changes and the motivations of the adaptation works. Through moderation and negotiation, the misrepresentation of White and non-White is modified and new perceptions of both parties are given. Moreover, it is also found that the transformations are motivated by a number of political and cultural issues to be a timeless commercial product in the international market. These results demonstrate that the transformations lead the TV series to success; although violence, profanity, alcohol, and smoking scenes are still found, yet they are delivered lightly for the sake of faithfulness to the original work.",
