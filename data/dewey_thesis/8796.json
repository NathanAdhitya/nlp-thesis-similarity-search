  "abstract": "In this thesis I am discussing the uncommon charactertraits of O-lan, the main female character in Pearl S. Buck?s The Good Earth. The setting of this novel is in China in the early 20 th century. The story bases on a poor farmer named Wang Lung with his family and how he struggles to become rich. Beside Wang Lung, the other important character in the novel is O-lan as the wife of Wang Lung. O-lan has a different characteristics compared with the characters of women at that time. The Purpose of this thesis is to know the uncommon characteristics of O-lan, which differentiate her with other women at that time. In analyzing this novel, I am using three literary theories: Characterization, Conflict and Setting. In the analysis I explain about some uncommon characteristics of O-lan. The first is that O-lan as a hard worker, second is O-lan as a strong woman, third is O-lan as a good decision maker and last, the fourth is that O-lan as a courageous woman. At the last chapter I can conclude that O-lan?s characteristics are different from other women at that time.",
