  "title": "Tales of Tristoria: exploring finding meaning of life through acceptance of death",
  "abstract": "Every human being has their own meaning. Those meanings of life are designed to empower each personâ€™s life, until they achieve their own fulfillment. People typically have different triggers that propel them to find their meanings of life, one of them is death anxiety. This novel follows the story of Trista, a woman who bears the Curse which has the power to kill her if she uses its power. As a result, she fears death and struggles to find her meaning of life, because she feels deep sorrow and anguish caused by her death anxiety. To better understand the matter, I will be using the Meaning Management Theory made by Dr. Paul Wong who theorized and made concepts about the meaning of life and death anxiety. After applying the theory for the story, I learned that death anxiety makes someone like Trista experience a life-changing experience to motivate her to find meaning, and the death anxiety subsides when a person finds meaning, he or she accepts and no longer fears death. A person who finds meaning in life will live life to the fullest, based on their own meanings.",
