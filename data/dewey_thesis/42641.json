  "title": "Introducing Gunawangsa Manyar Hotel through a marketing booklet",
  "abstract": "Gunawangsa Manyar Hotel is a three star hotel in the East of Surabaya. It was established in 2012 and has two locations: one in Manyar and the other one in Merr. As a three star hotel, Gunawangsa Manyar Hotel also has competitors such as Swiss BelInn Manyar Hotel, Fave Hotel, Core Hotel, and Ever bright Hotel. Compared to the competitors, Gunawangsa Hotel is not well known by many people. In introducing the hotel, they only use brochure and flyer for printed advertising. It means they did not succeed to introduce the hotel using its promotional tools and the promotional tools were not used effectively. Therefore, to introduce the hotel effectively, marketing booklet is the good solution for Gunawangsa Hotel since marketing booklet brings complete information needed by potential customers. Also, compared to brochure and flyer, potential customers especially companies, need a booklet that can show the picture and description clearly. The content of the booklet consists of company overview, product description, and contact information. In the product description, the USPs would be more emphasized. The USPs are obtained by the interview result with six guests of Gunawangsa Manyar Hotel. By having this marketing booklet, the company could introduce itself to the potential customers and increase the occupancy. Also, it helps the customers to have a better understanding about Gunawangsa Manyar Hotel.",
