  "title": "A Portrait of humanity as seen through the main character in the Wayward Bus by John Steinbeck",
  "abstract": "This thesis is about a portrait of humanity in John Steinbek's The Wayward Bus. Basically, the novel emphaz-ing more in the characterization than to the plot. The characters are a group of men who have no sense of humani-ty, since they are selfish. Those men are only concerned for their own interests. However, the humanity in this novel can be seen through the major character, Juan Chicoy who is kind, helpful and unselfish. Really, Juan is different from the other characters in the novel. He always puts others' interests on his own interest. Besides applying the theory of conflict and charac-ter, the writer also uses a theory of humanity. In addi-tion, she uses psychology theory about human behavior to support the analysis. The purpose of writing this thesis is to reveal humanity of the major character through his conflicts. By this analysis, the writer wants to prove that although Juan has conflicts with other men and within himself, whatever his decision, he always does the best for his fellow human beings. In this case his humanity is really portrayed.",
