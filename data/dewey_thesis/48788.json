  "title": "Increasing the brand awareness of Ambassador School Surabaya through a website",
  "abstract": "Ambassador School is a Christian school established in 2011. This school offers three main programs: Baby Class, Preschool, and Elementary. Two schools are similar to Ambassador School: Bethany Christian School and CMC/SMI School because of 3 aspects: the location, price, and service. The main problem of Ambassador School is related to low brand awareness, in which there are only a small number of people who know about this school and those who know are not able to explain what Ambassador School is. The best solution to this problem is increasing Ambassador School’s brand awareness by highlighting its strengths and uniqueness through a website. As the primary concern is to increase brand awareness, a website will be the best solution since it tells what a company sells and tells other information in detail that other promotional tools may not do the same. In addition, there are four highlighted USPs: academics, Christian values, character education, and independence. Underscoring all of this school’s strengths and uniqueness on a website will enable Ambassador School to increase brand awareness and lead them to be seen as a more credible and professional school.",
