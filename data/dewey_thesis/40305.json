  "title": "The Impact of customer satisfaction on financial performance and customer advocacy with customer loyalty as intervening variable on companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the influence of customer satisfaction on financial performance and customer advocacy with the role of customer loyalty as intervening variable, on companies with local brands in Indonesia. This study encompassed samples of 68 firm-years comprised 14 companies in various sectors listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange and whose brands appear on the published index of Indonesia Original Brands (IOB) between 2011 until 2015. From eight hypotheses proposed, three hypotheses are proven in this study. Based on data processing utilizing PLS, there is a strong positive influence of customer satisfaction to customer loyalty and from customer loyalty to customer advocacy. The results also suggested that customer satisfaction in Indonesia has a significant influence on short term financial performance when correlated to profitability, yet not on long term performance measured against market value. However, customer loyalty and customer advocacy do not have relationship with profitability performance and market value. This low significance of this relationship might be due to excessive resources spent to turn customer into loyal and be the advocate.",
