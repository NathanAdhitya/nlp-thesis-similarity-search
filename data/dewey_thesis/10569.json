  "abstract": "The contents of The Good Woman of Setzuan?s drama essentially discuss about a life of a woman who has an altruistic behavior with all her problems. Through this study, the writer is curious to know why Shen Te as the main female character has an altruistic behavior, how an altruistic behavior is revealed through Shen Te and what the results of having that characteristic to her. Thus, this study is conducted to uncover the issue of this drama. The purpose of this study is to find out the causes and several effects of her altruistic behavior towards herself. Therefore, to assists and enrich this study, the writer utilizes psychological approach concerning altruistic behavior which emphasizes the background of someone who has an altruistic behavior and theory of dissociative identity disorder concerning split personality. Later, in my findings I conclude that there are several causes that make Shen Te have an altruistic behavior which is being helped by gods, being helped by unknown people and having a bad past by being disappointed by her boyfriend. Also, in my findings I conclude that the effects of her altruistic behavior that influence her life which are her feeling anxiety and her dissociative identity disorder.",
