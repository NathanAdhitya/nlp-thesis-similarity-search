  "abstract": "Cellular telephone system further development is using satellites as the base stations. This kind of technology is called Personal Mobile Satellite Communication System (PMSCS) or SPCN (Satellite Personal Communication Network). This final report will describe one of the PMSCS that base on ICO system. Personal Mobile Satellite Communication System (PMSCS) combine a conventional GSM cellular communication technology with satellite system that act as repeater in outer space. SPCN is suitable for remote areas and location that can be categorized as \"hard to reach\" by GSM system. User will use dual mode handset (satellite or terrestrial) which can be chose automatic or manual. Comparison between ICO system with another SPCN system (Iridium and Globalstar) also will be presented in this paper. From that we can see more advantages that ICO System have. The result from this final report will give us the big picture from ICO system as a further development from GSM system and become our alternative solution for archipelago area surrounded by the sea and ocean like Indonesia.",
