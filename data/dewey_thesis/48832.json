  "title": "Reading strategies used in reading academic texts by students of high and intermediate reading proficiency levels",
  "abstract": "In this study, students' reading strategies of high and intermediate reading proficiency levels were qualitatively examined. Reading strategies are important factors that affect someone's reading proficiency. In education development, reading strategies are continuously carried out to facilitate the learning process and sharpen students' reading skills. This study aims to discover the reading strategies used by the English Department students with high and intermediate reading proficiency levels in reading academic texts. This study uses the theory about reading methods by Grabe (2009) combined with the interview questions by Mochtari (2002) to examine the reading strategies of ten participants with five people with high reading proficiency levels and five other people with intermediate reading proficiency levels. This study showed that high reading proficiency levels tend to use more reading strategies than students with intermediate reading proficiency levels. The most significant difference is in text-structure awareness and inferencing strategies. It indicates that the mastery of text structure is directly related to reading effectiveness. Without text structure awareness, other reading systems such as summarizing, inferencing, and elaborative interrogation will be seriously disrupted.",
