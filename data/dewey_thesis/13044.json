  "abstract": "The writer decides to analyze Toni Morrison's Sula and to choose a title A Study on the Conflicting Ideas of Black Women's Roles in Sula-and-Nel's Friendship because the writer is concerned with Sula's idea on feminism which causes her to conflict with Nel. Their different roles as women, one (Sula) as a radical feminist and a modern woman; and the other (Nel) as a conventional woman, lead their friendship to a conflict. This conflict triggers the writer to question and to analyze the causes of their conflict and the ending of their conflict. Their conflict is caused by Sula's sleeping with Jude, Nel's husband. This core of problem, as seen in the story, reveals their different ideas on the roles of black women. Sula thinks that sleeping with Jude is alright, but Nel does not think so. Their different ideas were in-fluenced by their different childhood background and dif-ferent society's values in which they live during their teenage years. They need each other as friends, but unfor-tunately, their ideas on black women's roles are never able to meet. From this ending of the analysis, it can be con-cluded then that Sula is the embodiment of a modern woman and Nel is the embodiment of a conventional woman.",
