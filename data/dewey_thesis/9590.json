  "abstract": "The writer carries out a research for her thesis entitled Cohesive Devices in \"Mr. Pecut\" Columns of Jawa Pos Newspaper. The research problem that comes up in this research is: in what way are cohesive devices used in \"Mr. Pecut\" pair of sentences. For the analysis, she uses theory of cohesive devices by Halliday and Hasan (1976). Of the forty cohesive devices in \"Mr. Pecut\" pairs of sentences, she found out that ellipsis is the type of cohesive devices, which are often used. For the semantic basis of cohesion, continuity of lexicogrammatical meaning is the type that most often occurs. From the findings, the writer concludes that the pairs of sentences of \"Mr. Pecut\" columns are entertaining but it is also challenging, because to some degree they also require thinking process on the part of the readers.",
