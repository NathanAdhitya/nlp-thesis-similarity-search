  "abstract": "As a final year student of Information & Communication Technology at Fontys University of Applied Sciences, I need to undergo an internship in a company. The internship itself must take place at least 90 working days. After looked for an internship among several companies, finally I chose ILUMY because the assignment matches with my interest, web development. I started being an intern at ILUMY on 31 January 2012 and will finish on 15 June 2012. The purpose of this report is to explain what I did and learned during my internship with ILUMY as a web developer. This report is also a requirement for the partial fulfillment of graduation project thesis. It focuses primarily on the research and the assignment handled. The research I did is about HTML 5 and its compatibility among several different browsers. Moreover, I have to figure out how HTML 5 can work as a web app in several mobile devices, additional to touch/gesture and sensors. Itâ€™s about screen behavior like resolution and orientation as well. This research is served as the basis to do my assignment to make a jQuery plugin for an image gallery. The plugin itself must work in multiple platforms, not only on the desktop browsers, but also on mobile devices browsers. Therefore it must support touch, gesture, orientation and sensor, which are the native features of the mobile devices.",
