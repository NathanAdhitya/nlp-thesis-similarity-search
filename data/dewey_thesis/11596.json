  "title": "Jim's struggles to be free in mark twain's the adventures of huckleberry finn",
  "abstract": "In this thesis, I am curious to know what conditions Jim faces during his escapes and what the impacts of his dealing with white people are as seen in one of Mark Twain?s novels, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. In order to analyze the novel and support the analysis, I use literary approach, by applying the theories of characterization and conflict. I also use the concept of freedom versus slavery to support my thesis as the historical background of slavery in America. The analysis is done firstly by studying the conditions that the main character, Jim faces during his escapes. I found that Jim has to encounter physical suffering, fear, and guilt so as to gain his freedom. Afterwards, I tried to look at the impacts of his dealing with white people. It is found that the struggle has changed the white people?s perspective on the black people?s intelligence as well as sensitivity. Finally, I gain an insight from this study that freedom is not given, but must be earned.",
