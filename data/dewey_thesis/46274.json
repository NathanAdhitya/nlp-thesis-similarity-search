  "title": "Promoting Tropicana Slim products to cafés in Surabaya using a marketing booklet",
  "abstract": "This is a Final Project report on a problem at PT Nutrifood Indonesia. Tropicana Slim (TS) is a range of sugar-free, low fat, low salt and low-calorie products. The target market for these products is those people who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle (diet) and prevent diabetes. TS is targeting the Hotel, Restaurant and Café (HORECA) Channel. There are various ranges of TS products that can be used in Cafés, but most of the decision-maker (either café owners or managers) do not know that TS has other products besides sweetener. Thus, in order to introduce other products to the decision-maker, a marketing tool is needed to give detail information about the products. A marketing booklet is a small book containing information about things for marketing purposes. Marketing booklet contains more spaces to be used to deliver the information. The contents consist of general information about the company, products description, benefits of the products and contact person. So that readers can be more convinced, Tropicana Slim’s Unique Strength Points (USP) will be emphasized in the marketing booklet contents. Thus, this marketing booklet will help to introduce the Tropicana Slim market and penetrate its various products to the Cafés.",
