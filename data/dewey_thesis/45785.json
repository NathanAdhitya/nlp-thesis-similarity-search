  "title": "The impact of consumers’ attitude on online video advertising towards product branding",
  "abstract": "Online video advertising is becoming much more common, and data shows that companies’ demand for online video advertising is increasing rapidly. However, there is a scarcity of research done about the consumers’ perspective on online video advertising, and there is still little evidence that online video advertising is beneficial for companies and the products being advertised. This research would like to find out the impact of consumers’ attitude on online video advertising on product branding. Consumer attitude itself is divided into cognitive, affective and behavioural components. The research was done using Android One as the case study. One hundred respondents from Surabaya were taken and personally asked to watch the online video advertising and fill in questionnaires. Data from the surveys were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results show that consumers’ attitude on online video advertising has a significant positive effect towards product branding and all three component of consumer attitude have a substantial positive impact towards product branding individually with an affective component having the most impact. Therefore it is recommended to promote using online video advertising and create online video advertising that focuses more on giving emotional implications to consumers.",
