  "title": "Improving KRN.BGT’s product knowledge through the list of FAQs on KRN.BGT’s Instagram stories highlights",
  "abstract": "KRN.BGT, established in April 2020 by Budi Santosa, is a fashion brand from Jogja Painting that is producing artistic masks by collaborating with other local artists. KRN.BGT is targeting people who like visual arts, such as drawing, painting, and digital illustration, and people aged 20s-30s. KRN.BGT has two competitors, which are Niion and Santai. Although KRN.BGT has a well-designed Instagram account, KRN.BGT still lacks product knowledge since they receive many questions from its customers through Instagram. Therefore, the best solution to improve KRN.BGT’s product knowledge for its customers is by creating a list of FAQs regarding KRN.BGT’s product on KRN.BGT’s Instagram Stories Highlights. I used the theory of a good FAQs from Biroscak (2019) and color contrast from Alscher (2019) and Evans (2019). The solution or tool that I suggested will give two benefits for KRN.BGT. Firstly, KRN.BGT will attract more potential customers since they can save more time to get their answers regarding KRN.BGT’s product. Secondly, KRN.BGT’s social media admin on Instagram does not need to repeat the same answers several times to the same questions from KRN.BGT’s customers regarding KRN.BGT’s products. Hopefully, this list of FAQs can give a better insight for KRN.BGT’s customers regarding KRN.BGT’s product.",
