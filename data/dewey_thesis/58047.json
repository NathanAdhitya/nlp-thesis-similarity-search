  "title": "Yuba - your to-go bar: a room temperature stable yogurt bar",
  "abstract": "This research is aimed to propose, develop, and evaluate a healthy snack substitute in the form of room temperature stable yogurt bar, Yuba, planned to be launched in Beijing, China, as a form of a new food product development (NFPD). To support the research, a secondary research was done to adapt a new simplified NFPD model out of three existing new product development (NPD) models. Moreover, the secondary research also covers other elements of the project such as innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship, target market, and market trends. Following that, primary research in the form of a focus group and questionnaire were also conducted to further measure the demand of the market. Through that, a sensory evaluation feedback profile was created to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the product, together with an updated costing and standard recipe for the product. Lastly, the authorâ€™s personal reflection of the whole NFPD process was also discussed to help future research avoid certain challenges and inspire similar products.",
