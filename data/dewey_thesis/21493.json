  "title": "A Study of theme in conrad's victory",
  "abstract": "Conrad's ear1iest'works were thematically rich but awkward in their plots. In his great period 1897 to 1911, Conrad wrote The Nigger of the Narcissus. Under The W.estern Eyes. Heart of Darkness and Nostromo. These novels show his purity and excellence in thought, expression, concept and technique. Conrad's great works had strongly influenced on some writers. The paradox of evil which is vividly dramatised in Heart of Darkness was developed by T.S. Elliot and Graham Greene. Victory tells about a character who alienates from society. One of his reasons that he alienates is that he distrusts other people. He suspects that other people will betray him. This Conradian theme, loyalty may entail treachery, is evident in most of Conrad's great works.",
