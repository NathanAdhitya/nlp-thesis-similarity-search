  "title": "The ideal image of girls in the fashion rubric of Gadis 2020 annual edition",
  "abstract": "The oldest girls’ magazine in Indonesia is Gadis. It has a huge number of readers. The latest data in 2016 said that Gadis sold more than 1000 copies per edition. On an online platform, Gadis has a lot of subscribers and followers. Although the development of technologies affects the production of other girls’ magazines, Gadis still survives until now. In the 2020 Annual Edition, Gadis published the trademark theme Fashion and Beauty. I found interesting pictures in its fashion rubric in which the models have contrasting body language, clothing, hairstyles, and color. As part of the media, Gadis selected particular pictures to be published in the magazine. Knowing this fact, there must be an ideal image of girls that Gadis 2020 Annual Edition is trying to portray. I used Semiotics theory by Roland Barthes to know the girls’ ideal image and how Gadis represents it. I found out that confidence, friendliness, and playfulness are three ideal images in the fashion rubric of Gadis 2020 Annual Edition. My finding is girls’ ideal image that Gadis represent is influenced by the characteristics of generations Z who are the target market of Gadis, as well as the characteristic of Indonesian that is being friendly.",
