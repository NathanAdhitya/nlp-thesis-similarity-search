  "abstract": "The analysis is on Sam Witwicky, an ordinary man with no any special ability that becomes a hero and saves the earth in Transformers Series. In this thesis, I will reveal the reason of how Sam Witwicky becomes a hero. I will use the theory of the hero’s journey in order to reveal the reason of Sam Witwicky’s long journey in becoming a hero. In analyzing this movie, I will analyze the stages of the hero’s journey that Sam undergoes in order to be a hero. These are his departure, initiation, and return. Meanwhile, in departure stage; there are four steps that Sam faces in order to find his identity. These are the call of adventure, refusal the call, meeting the mentor and crossing his first battlefield with his final separation. Next, in initiation stage I discover that Sam needs to face the road of trials, temptations, rebirth and the road back in order to have courage. Last, in the return stage; Sam needs to have wisdom before he becomes a real hero.",
