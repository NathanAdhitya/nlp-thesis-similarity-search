  "title": "Perancangan total productive maintenance di PT X",
  "abstract": "PT X is a company operating in the manufacturing industry, specifically in the production of cigarette filters. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is a crucial indicator used to measure machine efficiency during the production process. This study focuses on using the OEE method to measure the efficiency of the combiner machine at PT X. The main objective of this research is to improve the OEE of the combiner machine through the implementation of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). The results of implementing TPM in this study show an increase in the OEE of the combiner machine, with OEE rising to 72.62%. This improvement reflects the success of the strategies employed in optimizing machine performance and enhancing the overall production process.",
