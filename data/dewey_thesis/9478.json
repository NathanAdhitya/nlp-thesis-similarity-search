  "abstract": "This thesis is about father-daughter relationship as seen in Charles Dickens?s Dombey and Son. The problems are why the father and daughter have a bad relationship before the bankruptcy and how they improve the relationship after the bankruptcy. I use the library and the internet researches as the methodology. Characterization and conflict as the literary theories are applied in the analysis. The conflicts between the father and daughter certainly bring impacts to his daughter, maid, and also second wife. After the bankruptcy, the father wants to improve the relationship with his daughter by regretting his past behavior and building good communication. Finally, I conclude that the relationship of the father and daughter is bad when he is still prosperous, but after the bankruptcy, the relationship of the father and daughter becomes better.",
