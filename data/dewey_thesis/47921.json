  "title": "Evaluating stretch wrap alternative used in goods consolidation at an electronics manufacturing using triple bottom line",
  "abstract": "PT X is an electronics manufacturer that produces various electronics products and components. The company operates three manufacturing plants and one main warehouse; they are all located in separate buildings. Material and components required for manufacturing are stored and delivered from the main warehouse; each material and components are consolidated and put into a pallet and secured by stretch wrap before being transported to the three manufacturing plants. The pallet movement is a closed-loop, meaning the empty pallets are returned to the main warehouse. Stretch wrap is a single-use material once used are discarded. The use of such material is a sustainable issue. Using the Triple Bottom Line approach for the sustainable problem to evaluate and produce a suitable alternative that is sustainable and doesn’t burden the PT X’s financials. TBL approach selects an alternative that can replace stretch wrap by evaluating and measuring how each consolidation method and tool based on factors of Economic Measure, Environmental Measure, and Social & Human Measure. Resulting evaluation produces that the suggested alternative, pallet cover, is more economically viable, reusable, and relatively easy to use, meaning a better solution.",
