  "title": "An analysis of Serafina's conflicts as the effect of her romantic ideas in tennessee Williams's the rose tattoo",
  "abstract": "In this thesis, the thesis writer discusses Serafina's romantic ideas that lead her into conflicts within herself. In her life, Serafina tends to idealize herself as a person who is blessed more by Lady Madonna than the others. She also idealizes herself as a person who is able to be a faithful wife of a faithful husband. Serafina believes that as such a special person, she will never get troubles. When she has to face her husband's death and his adultery, she becomes frustrated. In her frustration, she is in conflicts within herself. Since she cannot accept the reality, she is in much misery and unhappiness. Later, when she meets a young man she falls in love with, she is driven to see the reality. Only when she is able to accept herself as what she is, she is at peace with herself and the world.",
