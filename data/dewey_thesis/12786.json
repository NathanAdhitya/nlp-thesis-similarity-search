  "title": "The Idea of American materialsm and taoism through the study of the main characters in Eugene O'Neill's marco millions",
  "abstract": "This study is about the idea of American Materialism and Taoism in Eugene O'Neill's Marco Millions which are discussed through the literary approach of characterization. The Writer thinks that the topic is very factual nowadays as man's vision of life turns to be materialistic in which people tend to neglect the spiritual and moral values and put much stresses on the physical achievement as a measuring rod to judge one's personal worth. O'Neill writes Marco Millions to satirize the American Materialism as well as to convey his eagerness toward the spiritual world of Taoism.The Idea of American Materialism pays attention to the fulfilment of self comfort and worldly satisfaction which is in contrast with the Taoism that emphasizes on the immortality : spiritual awareness and wisdom. Marco Polo who represents the character of American Materialism finally becomes spiritually impotent and insensitive because of his fleshy and superficial attitude of only pursuing for the satisfaction of worldly needs, whereas Kublai Kaan who represents the character of Taoism becomes spiritually mature as he accepts the destiny and surrenders to the Omnipotent. In conclusion, there is no improvement in the qualities of Marco who sinks into the shallowness of worldly satisfaction while Kublai Kaan finally finds the enlightenment about the secret of life.",
