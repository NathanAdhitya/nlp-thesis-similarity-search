  "title": "A Study of general George Washington's efforts to overcome the corruption in his army in Maxwell Anderson's Valley Forge",
  "abstract": "In Valley Forge, many of Washington's anny leave the war because there is not enough food, medicine, clothes, boots, war equipments, and unfortunately it is worsened by the winter. Moreover, the British attempts the soldiers by offering money and power to the anny who can help them to win the war. In this case, as the American leader, Washington is distressed by the condition. Through this thesis, the writer is curious to know the problems of corruption in Washington's anny and how Washington overcomes the problem. Through the analysis, the writer finds out about Lieutenant Cutting and General Conway who are bribed by the British. They admit themselves that they are traitors in Washington's army, and that the Congress is behind all of their actions. Knowing the problem, Washington is desperate and depressed. However, because of his characteristics: idealistic, dedicatic, religious, gentle, brave, and heroic, he has strength to survive in such a bad condition in which he almost defeated by the British. His characteristics support him to supply his army's need, morally and physically. He tries hard to supply food, ammunition, ships and anny for his men. He also gives hope and spirit to his army to keep on the war, fighting to gain independence for their country.",
