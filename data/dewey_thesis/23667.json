  "title": "Tommy Wilhelm's struggles for his self-identity in Saul Below's Seize the Day",
  "abstract": "This thesis presents an analysis on Tommy Wilhelm?s struggles for his self-identity Saul Bellow?s novella Seize the Day which always fail. In fact all those failures are the part of his struggles for his self-identity. That is why the thesis writer is curious to know the reasons behind Tommy Wilhelm?s failures in his struggle for his self-identity. In order to accomplish the objective of this thesis, the thesis writer uses literary devices, both characterization and conflict, and psychological concept of self-identity as supporting tools. The analysis of this thesis is divided into three parts. The first part is the analysis of Tommy Wilhelm?s struggles for his self-identity in Hollywood. The second part is the analysis of Tommy Wilhelm?s struggles for his self-identity in marriage. The third part is the analysis of Tommy Wilhelm?s struggles for his self-identity in business. As the conclusion, the thesis writer reveals the factors, as seen through Tommy Wilhelm?s character traits, as the reasons behind Tommy Wilhelm?s failures in his struggles for his self-identity. The failures give justification that Tommy Wilhelm?s character traits lead him into wrong decisions during the struggles for his self-identity.",
