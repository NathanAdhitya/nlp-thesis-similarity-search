  "title": "Kindred souls: a screenplay on the effects of domestic abuse on teenagers",
  "abstract": "The topic of my work is about domestic abuse on teenagers and the theme is the effects of abuse on the teenagers. This is a screenplay contains the two stories of two high school students who got the same experience which is being abuse by their family in their daily life. The first story is about a rich child named Yoel who is strictly controlled and under pressured by his snobbish father. Yoel suffers from depression and decides to commit a suicide at school. The other story is about an orphan boy known as Mikha. He is physically abused by his alcoholic uncle until it makes him trauma and has trust issues. Finally finds someone who is as miserable as he is, Mikha stops Yoel from doing a suicide and befriends him. The purpose of making this project is that I want people to question themselves and to be aware of what they are doing to their own children or family member. Unintentional or well-intentional the action, abusive behavior should be stopped. To shape the conflicts and characterization of my characters I use three theories; parental control, frustration-aggression, and effects of abuse. As for the genre, I choose tragedy for it will help me create the ending. In the end, both Mikha and Yoel want to seek freedom by running away. However, what will happen later is not as planned.",
