  "title": "A Study of the depressed women in Robert Frost's \"Home Burial\", \"A Servant to Servants\", and \"The Fear\"",
  "abstract": "This thesis is basically a study of the women characters as depressed women in Robert Frost's \"Home Burial\", \"A Servant To Servants\", and \"The Fear\". The writer of this thesis is curious to know why these women can be considered as depressed persons. Through the analysis, she wants to prove that each of the women characters in those three poems has experienced different psychological problems which are considered as the symptoms of depression. In order to accomplish the objective goal of this thesis, the writer uses conflict and characterization as the literary approach, and the psychological theory on depression as the tool to prove the women characters' depression. The woman character in \"Home Burial\" shows the symptoms of a depressed person after she loses her baby; and, in \"A Servant To Servants\", the hereditary insanity of the woman character has made her depressed. Whereas in \"The Fear\", the woman is haunted by her guilty feeling of betraying her husband and this situation makes her depressed. However, these women's condition will not become that worse if their spouses give them much attention which can be a very helpful thing for them in overcoming their depression.",
