  "abstract": "This study tries to know the language learning strategies used by the higher- proficiency learners of the 1999 and 2000 batches of the English Department, Petra Christian University. Besides, it also wants to know what strategies that are mostly used by them. In the present study, the higher- proficiency learners are represented by the students who have an average of very good grades ( > B+) in all language skill courses (Writing, speaking, reading and listening). The way the writer collects and analyses the data is quantitative. The quantitative data is collected according to the procedures established by Oxford (1990). The findings show that the higher- proficiency learners employ overall language learning strategies in the medium average. Then, they mostly use compensation strategies, followed by metacognitive, cognitive, social, affective and memory strategies. The results might imply that the ability to compensate despite the limitation of the language and motivation in learning are very important to improve the learners? language skills. Finally, language learning strategies are important; thus, we have to develop them.",
