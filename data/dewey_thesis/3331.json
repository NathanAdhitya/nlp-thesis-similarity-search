  "title": "A Study on main characters' defense mechanism as seen in edward albee's the death of bessie smith",
  "abstract": "Edward Albee is well known as American writer. According to him, the theatre is the mechanism for truth. Its method may be oblique, but it is ultimately concerned with the need to identify and embrace the real and the truth.(Bigsby, 1967, p.258). Theatre is a place to express the reality of life and dramatize the reality of man?s condition as their need to get self-congratulation and reassurance and presenting a false picture of man to man. In this thesis, I discuss The Death of Bessie Smith, one of Albee?s plays as my primary source. In this play, Edward Albee attempts to show how the unfulfilled needs of human beings influence their attitudes that give suffer to other. It expresses the reality of man?s condition as their effort to get self-reassurance and present a false picture of man to man. In this play, four main characters namely Father, Nurse, Orderly and Intern cannot fulfill their needs because of their inability to accept the reality. In this study I will analyze their unfulfilled needs and their defense mechanism with some psychological theories to support my analysis. Finally, it can be seen through the analysis that the main character?s unfulfilled needs due to their false attitudes in facing their lives. The defense mechanisms serve as a means to compensate their unfulfilled need.",
