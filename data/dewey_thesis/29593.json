  "abstract": "This study aims to discuss Mia’s psychopathic symptoms through the 18 items described in Psychopathy Checklist—Revised four-factor model. The purpose of this analysis is to discuss what psychopathic category Mia belongs to and to discuss why Mia, as a psychopathic person, commits suicide. Therefore, I use the theory that is described in Psychopathy Checklist—Revised four-factor model. This theory is used to give score to each factor described in the PCL-R, which are the interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, and antisocial. The analysis shows that Mia’s psychopathic symptoms fit these factors. Thus, through the analysis, the score can be given to each item discussed on the analysis. Moreover, it also shows that one of the factors, which is the factor of lifestyle, affects the probability of a psychopath to commit suicide because of the impulsivity that a psychopath has. In the end, it can be concluded that Mia is a psychopathic person who can be categorized as an intermediate psychopath, and this finding matches the theory that woman scores less than man in PCL-R. Also, it can be concluded that her suicidal act is affected by her past traumatic experience and her impulsivity.",
