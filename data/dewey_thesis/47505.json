  "title": "Designing a promotional video as a tool to promote Swiss-Belinn Airport Hotel Surabaya to its target market",
  "abstract": "This is a Creative Thesis Final Project Report on a problem at Swiss-Belinn Airport Hotel Surabaya (SAHS). SAHS is a hotel that is located strategically in close proximity to Juanda Airport. The hotel has three types of rooms; Deluxe, Grand Deluxe, and Suite. They also provide various facilities, such as restaurants, meeting rooms, pool, mini gym, etc. The target markets for these products are people who need meeting rooms and are away on business trips, vacations, and transit. However, while the hotel has no problem reaching various institutions, they are struggling to reach out to individual guests. Thus, to effectively introduce and inform the hotel to a wider population, a tool is needed. A Promotional Video (PV) is a short video or movie to promote a product or service to potential customers. PV can highlight the unique parts of the hotel. SAHSâ€™ unique strength points (USP) will be emphasized in the video. Thus, this promotional video will help to inform and introduce SAHS to its target market and influence them to buy their products and services. However, due to the current pandemic, creating the promotional video is unattainable. Thus, this thesis would cover interviews for the data and/until creating the plotline for the promotional video.",
