  "abstract": "I observed the difference in the relationship between the Cullens and the Blacks in Twilight regarding to their social and economical context. I am interested in analyzing about how the relationship between the Cullens and the Blacks is described in binary oppositions. By doing this analysis, I want to show that the relationship between the Cullens and the Blacks is in binary oppositions in terms of their economical and social status. Using the theory of binary opposition, I conducted this analysis by describing the relationship between the Cullens and the Blacks in some binary pairs. The result is the Cullens which represent the White has always been put in higher position than the Blacks which represents the Indian. This analysis shows that; the relationship between the Cullens and the Blacks represents the relationship between the White and the Indian in American society. The significance shows that the White always holds a higher position than the Indian regarding to any aspects in America, the White is the privileged group in American society while the Indian is the under-privileged and the downgraded group. In this sense, it can be concluded that this novel still confirms the idea that the White is higher than Indian in America, even though this country has declared that they banned any racial practices.",
