  "title": "The Failure of the marriage between Dorothea Brooke and Edward Casaubon in George Eliot's middlemarch",
  "abstract": "This paper deals with marriage failure found in George Eliot?s novel Middlemarch, seen through Dorothea Brooke and Edward Casaubon. The thesis writer is interested in finding the factors that cause their marriage to fail. She assumes that the failure is caused by both Dorothea and Mr. Casaubon. Therefore, the thesis writer needs to divide the factors into two groups; the factors that cause the failure of the marriage from Dorothea?s side as well as from Mr. Casaubon?s side. From the author?s characterization, which reveals Dorothea and Mr. Casaubon?s attitudes, the thesis writer finds out the causes of the failure. Besides, the description of Victorian women and marriage helps the thesis writer understand the causes of the failure. The thesis writer concludes that Dorothea and Mr. Casaubon fail in their marriage because of some factors such their character traits, the absence of love and the difference of age. The fact that Dorothea has been disillusioned about her husband and marriage makes her unhappy with her marriage.",
