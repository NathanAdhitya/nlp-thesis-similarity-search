  "abstract": "This study is about the choice of codes used by the employees in communicating with their superior and their co-worker. The writer chose this topic for her study since she realizes that Indonesia is a multilingual society. The thing that has caught the writerâ€™s attention and curiosity to write on this particular topic is the language that is used by the employees in a work place like switching when they talk to the superior and the co-worker. The aims of this study were to describe and to analyze the codes which were used by the employees, to find out the dominant code they chose, and to explain what factors affected their choice of code. The writer reviewed codes, code switching, code mixing, and social factors as her related literature. For the source of data, the writer used a phone to record the conversation and the verbatim data from her observation. The writer chose and collected the data she needed. Then she analyzed the data using tables. Through the analysis, the writer found that the employees chose to use standard or casual Indonesian codes in communicating with their superior. This happened because they wanted to show their respect to the superior to keep their social distance intact. Whereas they used Javanese codes in communicating among themselves because they did not need to highlight any respect. They felt that they were equals.",
