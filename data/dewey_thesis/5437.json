  "abstract": "This thesis entitled \"The study of the Main Character?s relationship in 'Secrets' through Illocutionary Acts\" is a study of illocutionary acts in one of teenager novels, Sweet Valley High series, which is written by Kate William, an American writer. The writer analyzed the conversations between the main character toward the other characters in seven chapters based on Searle?s theory of illocutionary acts. The writer wants to answer her research questions about the most types which are used by the main character toward the other characters to know her relationship towards the others. She found out that the illocutionary acts used in \"Secrets\" are representatives, directives, commissives, and expressives. The most type of illocutionary acts used by Elizabeth to Enid is directives while the most type of illocutionary acts used by Elizabeth to Jessica is representatives. From this finding, it shows that Elizabeth likes to direct Enid, since her highest type of illocutionary acts is directive. Moreover, in Elizabeth?s relationship with Jessica, Elizabeth likes to show her state of mind by alluding and stating about something.",
