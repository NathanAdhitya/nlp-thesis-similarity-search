  "title": "A Study of the role if the speaker in walt whitmans passage to India as the True Son of God the Poet",
  "abstract": "This thesis is an analysis of Passage to India, a poem which is written celebrating the Atlantic Cables, the Suez Canal and the American Transcontinental Railroad which were built to connect the West and the East, Europe.and Asia, so that the journey became much easier and shorter. Through this poem, Whitman intended to unite the West and the East so that his purpose to get the spritual wisdom and the truth of the world-could be achieved. Therefore, through his spokesman, the speaker, he elevates himself as the \"True Son of God\", the poet, because he considers himself as somebody who is omniscient and can give solution to the Western who seemed to have a restless condition. Finally, the writer of this thesis can conclude that the speaker elevates himself as the \"True Son of God\" because he knows that without his help, the Western are always in the restless condition. That is why, the speaker would bring them to the place where the spiritual life can be found.",
