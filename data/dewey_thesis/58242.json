  "abstract": "Starting from a company that provides high-end furniture manufacturing services and as an interior contractor, CV. Keravindo Suryatama, known as Modico, has produced many interior products based on client wishes. Now, with a vision to expand its market, Modico wants to be present as a high-end furniture brand in Indonesia with its own furniture collection. This design will raise the main issue of how the brand image can be reflected through the design of the bedroom furniture collection and how the Modico bedroom furniture collection can elevate the atmosphere of the room so that it looks beautiful and luxurious to be placed in the house. The design thinking method will be used in this design. The stages carried out in this method are empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test, and implementation. This design produces a design collection of furniture for the bedroom in the form of a bed, nightstand, and seat with the application of a modern contemporary style. From the design later, a final 1:1 work will be produced as one of the outputs of this design.",
