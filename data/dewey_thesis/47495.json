  "title": "Series of discrimination: exploring discrimination among children",
  "abstract": "This series of childrenâ€™s literature focuses on discrimination among children based on their race, sex, disability, physical attractiveness, and social class. The goal is to find the ways children discriminate against their friends and how they cope with discrimination. To do so, this creative thesis uses the concept of prejudice and discrimination and the Coping theory. The series shows that children can verbally, behaviorally, and relationally discriminate against their friends and that children can use problem-focused coping with discrimination. Therefore, by understanding ways bias manifests itself and knowing how to deal with discrimination, children can detect discrimination and learn to cope with it.",
