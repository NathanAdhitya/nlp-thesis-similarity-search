The problem is the sales of this company keeps decreasing since the pandemic happened. That is the reason why this company still struggles to get new customers. However, the company plans to expand its target market, especially during this pandemic. The solution is by expanding the target markets through Facebook with an online catalogue. On Facebook, the company will include the photo products and the price as well as on the online catalogue. The online catalogue will be published on the Facebook marketplace page in the form of a link. The catalogue was created using the principles of Bethina Oksen Bendroff, 2021. Therefore, by having a Facebook with an online catalogue, Mebel Sumber Jati will be able to expand their new target market",
