  "title": "Finding jingga and other stories: Children’s picture books exploring disenfranchised grief",
  "abstract": "This thesis revolves around disenfranchised grief in children. Disenfranchised grief refers to a loss that is not acknowledged, not socially accepted, and not discussed in public which makes people think that they have no right to grieve that loss. With children’s picture books as the creative form and adventure as the genre, this thesis presents what causes children to grieve and how they process grief. My stories depict Putra, Gwen, Daniel, Deborah, and Gabriel experiencing disenfranchised grief because their attachment to people or things they care about is broken, regardless of how trivial it is. Onward, they process grief by going through the four phases of grieving by John Bowlby namely numbness, yearning and searching, disorganization, and re-organization to seize acceptance.",
