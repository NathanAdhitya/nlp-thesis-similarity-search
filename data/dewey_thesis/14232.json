  "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with a study on the development of Alyosha's humanity through his actions as seen in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel entitled The Brothers Karamazov. The writer wants to know how Alyosha Karamazov develops his humanity even though he comes from an unhappy family. At the beginning, Alyosha is a person who has no sense of humanity. Yet, later on, he succeeds to develop his sense of humanity because of Father Zossima, his religious elder, teaches him many good lessons when he lives in the monastery. The purpose of writing this thesis is to find out the things that Alyosha does to develop his humanity. Thus, in order to achieve the writer's purpose, three literary theories:.setting, characterization, and conflict are used to support the analysis. In addition, the sociological theory, which is theory of family, and the meaning of humanity are also included to produce a better analysis. After making the research on this topic, the writer concludes that Alyosha succeeds to develop his humanity based on Father Zossima's teachings because his actions follow his elder's teachings.",
