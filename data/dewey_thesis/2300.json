  "title": "A Study of ghotic elements in colleridge's poems: the rime of the ancient mariner \"Kubla Khan\" and Christabel",
  "abstract": "The poems that are discussed in this thesis are Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. \"Kubla Khan, and Christabel. These poems consist of Gothic elements that can be used to convey some human problems and some truths about life. In the poems, Coleridge portrays vividly the domination of Gothic elements such as the supernaturalism, the eerie quality, the magic and the mystery. However, the purpose of these poems is not just to exploit the frightening and terror sides. Coleridge is able to treat his supernatural themes in such a way that the Gothic elements in the poems can be used to portray human problems such as the misery of the mariner and the crew after the killing of the albatross, the vision of creation and destruction in \"Kubla Khan\", and the kindness of Christabel that leads to her own destruction. Also, through the events presented in the poems, a reader can see some truths that can be found in real life such as the moral and dramatic truths learnt by the mariner in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. the truth about human nature and human life in \"Kubla Khan\" and the truth about kindness which does not always result in goodness in Christabel.",
