  "abstract": "This thesis discusses the cultural strategy model applied by Levi Strauss and Co (Levi’s) to make new advertisements. This study aims to show readers that there are some differences between Levi’s old advertisement and new advertisement. In the past about the 90's, Levi’s advertisements showed that Levi’s jeans made adult people who wear them cool. The influencers were elegant adults. However, there was a time when climate change and global warming attacked the earth and it was caused by clothing overconsumption. The more demand of people, the more energy is needed to produce the clothes. Climate change and global warming are the environmental problems that disrupt society. That is why they need environmentally friendly and sustainable clothing. Levi’s may take this opportunity and make a new advertisement with a new concept. It is because the company uses a cultural strategy model. It is the process of making the advertisement with the steps are cultural orthodoxy, the social disruption, the ideological opportunity, the source material, and the cultural strategy and tactics.",
