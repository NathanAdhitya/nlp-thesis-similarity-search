  "title": "Language features used by Jeffree Star - the top English speaker beauty vlogger",
  "abstract": "The writer conducted this study to find out the women’s and men’s language features used by Jeffree Star in his monologue entitled Full Face of Brands That Hate Me. The theories of language features proposed by Lakoff (2004) and Coates (2004) were used as the theoretical framework. This study employed a qualitative approach in which the writer transcribed and analysed all Jeffree Star’s utterances. The results of data analysis showed that Jeffree Star used color terms, adjectives, hedges, intonations, grammar, politeness, swear words, commands and directives, and questions. Jeffree Star also occasionally used two language features at the same time namely hedges and politeness, color terms and hedges, grammar, and questions, swear words and hedges, and swear words and politeness. It seems that the use of language features by Jeffree Star was influenced by the topic of the talk and the gender identity of Jeffree Star and his viewers or subscribers. Further studies involving more subjects, objects, or other socio variables are clearly needed to achieve a better understanding of the use of women’s and men’s language features.",
