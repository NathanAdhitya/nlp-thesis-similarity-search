  "title": "New free tourism guide for Amsterdam : how a free tourism guide for Amsterdam can gain a competitive advantage",
  "abstract": "This research has been done as a dissertation for the IBMS course of the Hogeschool Inholland. The subject of how a new free guide for A*dam can gain a competitive advantage has been chosen, since I would like to develop such a free guide in the future. In the introduction, the aims of the research will be discussed and the research questions formulated. Within the secondary research it has been made clear that the Cost focus strategy should be chosen in order to gain a competitive advantage. The Differentiation focus strategy will also be used, since the A*dam&Eve guide will be different from its competitors in several ways. By means of the competitive analyses it has been made clear how the A*dam&Eve guide can differentiate itself from the competitors. For the primary research two types of questionnaires are made. The first one is with 50 young adults, of whom 25 A*dam citizens and 25 non-A* dam citizens. In order to understand their-views on the current tourism medium instruments and to get to know how they spend their free time and what their favourite places are. The second primary research is conducted under 20 potential customers, which are business owners in Amsterdam, who have something original to offer. At last the outcomes of the secondary research and the primary research will be compared and the final conclusions and recommendations will be made.",
