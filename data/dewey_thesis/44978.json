  "abstract": "The short story is one of the types of popular literature in Indonesia. In short stories, love is one of the most popular topics for the Indonesian audience. However, amongst various types of love that exist, a mother’s love is talked about the most. Due on its popularity, the writer decides to analyze how mothers express their love for their children in a compilation book titled “Rectoverso”. Aside from analyzing the expressions of love that the mothers do, the writer also determines the effects that the mothers experience due to their choices regarding love. By using the theory of love and the concept of motherly love from the book “The Art of Loving” by Erich Fromm, the writer finds that the mothers have to face several choices that can give impacts toward their children and themselves. When the mothers face these choices, the decision they make is caused by their love toward their children. Furthermore, mothers tend to prioritize their children’s needs and happiness instead of their own. The mothers are also ready to sacrifice themselves and feel fulfilled once their children’s needs are fulfilled first. The impacts they experience may be positive or negative, depending on the situation.",
