The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted social interactions, leading to a significant decline in youth participation. However, post-pandemic observations revealed a notable increase in engagement among the youth members of GKT (Gereja Kristen Tuhan) Banyuwangi. This shift raised important questions about the role of leadership communication in revitalizing youth involvement. This study used a qualitative case study approach, data were collected through participant observation, interviews with four informants, and document analysis. The findings suggested that the youth leader employed varied communication styles depending on his social role within the organization. As a leader, he utilized controlling, structuring, and relinquishing styles; as a coach, he adopted a more directive approach; and as a teacher and peer, he favored an egalitarian style. These communication strategies, shaped by Christian values and local cultural norms of Banyuwangi, played a significant role in fostering motivation and participation among youth members."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1yQCqi4AAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/21557/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A8FyFbl8s2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Thematic content refers to the consistency of messages conveyed by content creators as part of their digital identity construction. These media messages were initially designed to entertain, educate, and inform followers. However, these practices have shifted towards monetization, which leads to commodification. We aim to assess the impact of this commodification with the following question: How do TikTok content creators experience the commodification of authenticity in commercial video production? Our study is a qualitative descriptive analysis using case study as a method. Key findings reveal that creators deliberately craft their digital identities to enhance popularity and financial gain. Authenticity, once a genuine trait, is now commodified to increase value. Moreover, creators often develop digital alter egos as part of this process. The implications of this study include: a) the enhancement of promotional culture that threatens the true values of authentic interactions on the platform, and b) the potential devaluation of authenticity due to its extensive exploitation by content creators."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1yQCqi4AAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://proceeding-mediacon.petra.ac.id/index.php/med/article/view/16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EnMHFKlTyVQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
