Moving beyond the traditional understanding of programming as problem-finding-solving, this research redefines it as a dynamic framework bridging theoretical insights and practical design applications. Through a qualitative case study methodology, the paper examines three landmark projects with similar functions by Bjarke Ingels Group\u20148 House, The Mountain, and Urban Rigger\u2014to explore the transformative potential of programming. The analysis positions programming as an integrative tool that aligns spatial, functional, and contextual dynamics to address both immediate and future architectural challenges. Program mixing with relational functions is conceptualized as a strategic approach that harmonizes diverse functions within a single design, fostering innovative and hybrid solutions. Adaptive reuse, reframed as a multi-time design response, focuses on revitalizing existing structures to meet evolving societal and environmental needs. These case studies illustrate how programming establishes a dynamic framework that enables architects to creatively reimagine constraints as opportunities.

This  response  to  issues regarding technology development, design strategy, and the role of DSF   in   buildings   related   to   aesthetic,   environmental,   and materiality issues in design practice. A qualitative approach with a descriptive observation case study method was conducted on various modern  residential  architectural  designs buildings  in  Indonesia  to illustrate how designers positioned this double skin facade in their design.  The  connection  between  the  DSF  with  tectonic,  aesthetic, sustainability, and environmental issues is shown in this study. This paper  set  the  study  boundaries  for  exploring  residential  designs typology because the limited scale  project  allowed  the designer to have  considerable  flexibility  and  exploration  of  creativity.  The residential architectural design also allows the role of the DSF to be integrated with a passive design strategy, compared to commercial or  public  building  design.  The  findings  suggest  various  strategies and design exploration mapping related to DSF design. The results show that it can form a new character for contemporary Indonesian architecture and become a catalogue of exploratory, strategic, and responsive design elements in its practices."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3yEeFKYAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17296942337533009542", "cites_id": ["17296942337533009542"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/20413/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ht4RsWkVC_AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 1}}

This paper discusses the interrelationship among virtual social media, waste management practice, and community-based economics in supporting sustainability and zero waste in the digital era. In particular, it attempts to identify the potential connections of social media in extending new environmental practices. Observation of two types of Indonesian Instagram accounts (personal and group) of waste-related illustrates that social media can act as an alternative platform to respond to waste issues. Qualitative case studies demonstrate the relationship between virtual social media, waste, and creative economic potential in various communities in Indonesia. This analysis focuses on independent efforts, especially regarding their potential related to environmental and economic factors. The findings show that virtual platforms \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3yEeFKYAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7138914808137320426", "cites_id": ["7138914808137320426"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/1098/1/012070/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6gfNxDGFEmMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 2}}

This article conducts a study  on  the  production  of  social  space  in  urban  corridor  spaces  in  Tunjungan,  Surabaya.  The theoretical  framework  used  in  this  research  is  an  understanding  of  space  formed  due  to  social factors, not just physical. An in-depth field observation method illustrates how a street space can be a reflection and practice of producing social space related to the issue of temporality. Through this city  study,  it  is  also  proposed  to  develop  an  architectural  design  that  can  accommodate  space dynamics. The findings of this study indicate that there is excellent potential for non-activity spaces, such as road corridors, as spaces for social interaction to occur in city life through temporary city elements.
