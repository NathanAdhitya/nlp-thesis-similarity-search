Using a phenomenological approach, we studied the impact of Instagram\u2019s visual features, such as filters, geotagging, and hashtags, on user interactions and perceptions of architectural spaces. The research demonstrates that Instagram transforms traditional architectural experiences into dynamic visual narratives that integrate real and virtual elements, altering our understanding of space and time. While acknowledging that architectural experience encompasses form, function, and historical context, this paper specifically focuses on Instagram\u2019s role in mediating perceptual experiences. By analyzing user engagement patterns and content trends, the study highlights how Instagram shapes architectural design practices and the creation of spaces tailored for digital interaction.

Meanwhile, in the life of Nusantara people, fire is not only understood physically as part of the cooking process, it is also a non-physical element that has the power to revive. Besides the physical role, fire also has a non-physical role, namely spirituality. Spiritually, fire is a power capable of burning, a symbol of purification and cleansing. The Nusantara people have special beliefs about fire. Fire is the essence of human spiritual life, giving life, warmth and purification. Additionally, pawon or the traditional fireplace is a supporting means of fire, the supporter of family life. Although the pawon is a physical means, its existence is essential and cannot be separated from fire and women. Hence, women, fire, and pawon are three elements that are inseparable parts of the Nusantara people s lives. Fire always interacts with the pawon and women in every dwelling, because fire is a symbol of womens chastity. The correlation of these three elements forms a spatial core that is always present in Nusantara dwellings, that originated from these three elements. The structure of this spatial core can be divided into two patterns: centralized and linear.

The traditional house represents past ways of living and building which are full of cultural wisdom and values. The houses themselves and the cultural values they represent have been inherited, rebuilt, reshaped, and redefined in accordance with cultural and changing architectural traditions. This study aims to discover the characteristics of the cultural wisdom in the Betang Dayak Ngaju house in Central Kalimantan, along its influence on modern construction practises. Descriptive analysis was conducted to discover the wisdom of symbolic meanings and the various forms of sustainability in the present. The results showed that the Betang house displays a combination of ancient vernacular traditions and foreign architectural traditions that apply the typical Batang Garing metaphor as a core concept that illustrates the structural unity between the house and its environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3XDlZdAAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14364383307122593433", "cites_id": ["14364383307122593433"], "pub_url": "https://knepublishing.com/index.php/KnE-Social/article/download/7582/13293", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mc6XFoOKWMcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1, "2024": 2}}
