Her underestimation for pivotal moments of change and chance, as highlighted by the Chaos Theory in Careers, leads her to seize fake opportunities while missing genuine positive ones. The story focuses on Catherine and her surroundings as she faces the consequences of underestimating change and chance in her career and her journey to recover from these mistakes.

So, the analysis is focused on the micro level behaviors being grasped through some verbal expressions and actions against the background of multimodal discourse analysis of some obvious semiotic resources in the context of the overturned pre-existing practices of the 2024 Presidential election. President Jokowi displayed some semiotic behaviors of being \u201cmencla-mencle\u201d (destructively inconsistent) and \u201ctipu-tipu\u201d (destructively deceptive) that are definitely constitutive of destructive politics.

While love is a widely-known emotion that has been a norm for everyone, many still do not know the dark side of too much love, which can be the result of mental illnesses such as obsessive love disorder and many more. Obsessive love disorder itself is a mental disorder where someone has an overwhelming obsessive desire to possess and protect another person. Using screenplay as the form and drama-thriller as its genre, I will show the development and symptoms of obsessive love disorder through Sinclair as the main character. She will also show how she manipulates people around her to fulfill her love obsession. In the screenplay, Sinclair will manipulate Charlot\u2019s love for her by using him to get the man she obsessively loves."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "y1WL5H8AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17220364688004849298", "cites_id": ["17220364688004849298"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/20348/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kp41Q3IG--4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 2}}

Permasalahan utama masyarakat, desa Begagan Limo yang memiliki banyak situs peninggalan kerajaan Majapahit ini memiliki aset berupa gamelan dan kelompok campursari yang tidak tergarap dengan baik. Masyarakat ingin meningkatkan Wisata Budaya ke situs-situs peninggalan Majapahit dengan mengembangkan seni gamelan/campursari. Namun jumlah seniman masih terbatas, keterampilannya masih perlu diasah dan dikemas-kinikan, dan ketrampilan mengelola wisata budaya pengelolaan masih perlu ditingkatkan. Solusi yang diusulkan, terutama yang dapat dilaksanakan di masa pandemi ini adalah pelatihan gamelan/campursari, penambahan alat musik gamelan, pelatihan pengelolaan obyek wisata budaya, dan pelatihan pembuatan situs daring.  Namun mereka perlu tempat untuk melaksanakan kegiatan tersebut, dan tempat itu adalah desa wisata Begagan Limo sendiri yang perlu ditingkatkan kondisinya.  Kegiatan yang dilaksanakan adalah 1) Identifikasi kebutuhan pelatihan gamelan dan pelengkapan peralatan gamelan dengan metode observasi bersama para seniman 2) Pelaksanaan pelatihan dan pelengkapan gamelan dengan metode workshop dengan mengundang pelatih/pakar gamelan 3) Pelatihan dan regenerasi pemain gamelan dan tari. Saat ini gamelan sudah dilengkapi dan dilaras. Latihan sudah berjalan secara rutin dan regenerasi dengan mengajari anak-anak dan remaja sedang berjalan.

People spend more time at home than they do outside. People who like movies during this time can enjoy the cinema. However, during the covid-19 pandemic, it must be done online to follow strictly regulated restrictions on community activities to avoid the uncontrolled spread of the virus. As a result, streaming platforms with the advancement of internet technology are increasingly playing a role in providing online services for movie fans. This study investigated the effects of perceived ease of use, usefulness, enjoyment, and intention to use online platforms on behavioral intention in online movies during the Covid 19 pandemic. The questionnaires were distributed by sending google form links to respondents who have a streaming platform subscription in Indonesia. As many as 772 questionnaires were filled out completely and could be processed. Data analysis was done by using partial least squares with Smart PLS software. The results have shown that eight proposed hypotheses have been supported in this study. Perceived ease of use positively affects the perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and intention to watch movies online. Furthermore, perceived usefulness affects perceived enjoyment and intention to watch movies online. Perceived enjoyment influences intention to use and behavioral intention. Finally, intention to use online platforms influences behavioral intention.
