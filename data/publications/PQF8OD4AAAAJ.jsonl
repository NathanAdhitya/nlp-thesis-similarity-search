This medical application will greatly support the development of cancer treatment and reduce the cancer fatality rate. However, ZIF-L as a type of metal-organic framework (MOFs) faces several challenges to be implemented in biomedical applications which impact the drug loading and release mechanisms.MethodsCNCs/ZIF-L composites were fabricated via a green in-situ method using CNCs mass percentages of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 % of Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O. All composites were tested for the DOX loading and release mechanisms and antioxidant activity.Significant findingsHere, the addition of CNCs enhances the DOX loading capacity of CNCs/ZIF-L composite up to 1508.91 \u00b1 7.72 mg/g due to the presence of abundant active functional groups.
