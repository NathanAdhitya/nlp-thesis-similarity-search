The results showed that alkali treatment leads to an increase in composite stiffness and strength. A maximum is achieved in these properties at around 5 wt% NaOH content of the treating solution. The increase in properties was assigned to the improvement in inherent fiber characteristics. Acoustic emission testing and electron microscopy showed that the two main local deformation processes related to the fibers are their fracture and debonding; the latter is accompanied by the shear yielding of the matrix. Increased inherent strength of the fibers results in an increase in the fracture initiation stress and fracture energy of the composites. Interfacial adhesion has a slight effect on stiffness, but more significant on strength and impact resistance. Changing adhesion modifies the relative importance of local deformation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "PQF8OD4AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=501712727425304627", "cites_id": ["501712727425304627"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266353820322181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M0h6QRFx9gYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 3, "2024": 10, "2025": 5}}

Hasil uji flexural pada prototype komposit package tray menunjukkan kekuatan flexural 7.4 MPa, di mana nilai kekuatan ini masih dibawah kekuatan flexural produk woodboard dari industri (35.58 MPa).

The process of 3D printing constructs three-dimensional objects from CAD models, usually by adding lay-ers by a layer of material in a row. Therefore it is also called mak-ing addictive manufacturing. Along with the development of rapid prototyping, there are many choices of materials on the market to make parts of 3D printing. The material can be in the solid filament, liquid resin, or powder. Solid filament FDM technology material is the most commonly used by industry   these materials such as ABS, PLA, PETG, HIPS, and others. In 3D printing products, several var-iables can be observed to produces specific responses desirable. Some of the responses are the efficiency of materials, dimensional accuracy of mechanical, and others. This research was conducted to compare ABS and PLA materials in the fused deposition modeling process. The strength and dimensional accuracy are the response that used in this study. The study reports that ABS has more signifi-cant tensile strength than PLA. The tensile strength of ABS is 7.66 MPa and 1.79 for PLA. PLA found has a more accurate dimension compare to ABS.
