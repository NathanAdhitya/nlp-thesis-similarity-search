Various complaints about the use of the Lentera, such as information that is too crowded, the location of the features is not clear then causing the failure, and the presentation of information that is not clear. Evaluation of the implementation of online learning at Lentera and Google Classroom also needs to be done. The evaluation process is carried out by integrating the Kansei Engineering and Quality Function Deployment methods. Using the average assessment results with semantic differential scale, Google Classroom is a good e-learning tool for every Kansei words. There are 11 proposed improvements that can be applied in Lentera"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "k4S3phcAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/13366", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UhlTHoVBZB4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

The research involved a total of 460 respondents affiliated with 50 small-scale Indonesian food enterprises in Surabaya. The respondents were required to be at least 17 years old, and the enterprises were expected to specialize in selling Indonesian food within the price range of IDR 8000 to IDR 25,000. The data was analyzed using two methods: factor analysis and structural equation modeling employing GeSCA. The findings indicate that both service quality and marketing mix exert significant influence on customer satisfaction. Furthermore, service quality directly and significantly impacts customer loyalty, whereas the direct influence of marketing mix on customer loyalty is not statistically significant. Notably, customer satisfaction significantly affects customer loyalty, acting as a mediator that links the variables of service quality, marketing mix, and customer loyalty within SIFE."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "k4S3phcAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/118318437/2247-Article_Text-4195-1-10-20230930.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mleTJWP8-M8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

This study aims to investigate the level of physical activity, sleep duration and sleep quality of undergraduate students in East Java during the covid 19 pandemic; and at the same time prove whether the level of physical activity and sleep duration affect the sleep quality of students. The respondents of the research were 188 students, and the data analysis used included descriptive statistics and multipl regression. The results of this study indicate that most students have mild to moderate levels of physical activity (72.43%), lack of sleep duration (74.47%), and poor sleep quality (66.49%).

The solution given to overcome the problem is to prepare training modules from 7 QC Tools and Project Management which are made simple and attractive so that they are easy to understand. The Project HR Supervisor has tested the module through trial and inspection activities. The HR Project and the Training Team have evaluated by comparing the old and new modules.
