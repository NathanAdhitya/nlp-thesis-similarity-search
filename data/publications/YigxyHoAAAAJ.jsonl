Lockdowns imposed limitation on disabilities because of their jobs, with high-frequency physical interactions, such as masseurs, musicians, food hawkers, online motorcycle taxi drivers, and students.  Further, some University students with disabilities are affected by the closure of some universities. However, in some universities, disadvantaged students, including students with disabilities, could still utilise campus facilities, such as computers and the internet. Therefore, many students, especially those with disabilities, need accessible pedestrian paths to reach those campuses from nearby residential areas.

The barriers of ID implementation is the limited awareness of decision makers and the limited number of librarians. Besides that, the Special Assistance Corner and Disability Service is constructed in PCU Library, causing more educational access to PwDs and reducing poverty of PwDs, especially the Women with Disabilities.
