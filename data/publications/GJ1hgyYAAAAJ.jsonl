This experimental study aims to investigate the bond strength of embedded steel reinforcement in vibration-based 3DCP mortar. The parameters varied are reinforcement diameter and direction of printing. It is found that average bond stress decreases as reinforcement diameter increases. Furthermore, 3DCP specimens with bars placed parallel to the printing direction have relatively higher bond stresses as compared to the ones with bars placed perpendicularly. As compared to conventional cast specimens, 3DCP specimens have higher bond stresses which might be due to vibration-based 3DCP mortar.

CFBC burning process is gaining more popularity due to its compact size, high efficiency and lower burning temperature compared to the pulverized coal combustion (PCC) burner. The CFBC burner produces fly ash with different physical properties compared to the PCC burner, ie the fly ash is not rounded, and required higher water content for comparable workability. The CFBC fly ash also has a high sulfur content that is detrimental for hardened concrete. Due to its drawbacks, the CFBC hardly used as cementitious material and geopolymer precursor. This study focuses on comparing variations in the concentration of NaOH solution and variations in the ratio of alkaline activators to the setting time and compressive strength of geopolymer mortars on a new class of CFBC fly ash, which have low sulfur content. The concentrations of NaOH solution were 6M, 8M, 10M, and 12M, while the alkaline activator ratios used were 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5. It was concluded that the low sulfur CFBC fly ash has a potential to be utilized as geopolymer precursor, however, with a shortcoming in its high water demand. The CFBC fly ash used in this study resulted in a geopolymer matrix with good compressive strength and stability. The water demand varies with the fly ash sampling time shows the challenges in the utilization of the fly ash. The highest mortar\u2019s compressive strength, 33.4 MPa at 90 days was achieved at NaOH concentration of 8M and ratio of sodium silicate solution to sodium hydroxide solution of 2.5 with excellent stability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GJ1hgyYAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11123364479317551247", "cites_id": ["11123364479317551247"], "pub_url": "http://ced.petra.ac.id/index.php/civ/article/view/22975", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j6jrUA8hXpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 0, "2024": 1}}

The use of borax as an additive has been reported due to its potential to prolong the setting time. In this study, the use of a significantly higher dosage of borax is explored. The results show that the addition of borax up to 20% of fly ash, by mass, into the alkaline solution prolongs the setting time by up to 90 min. Conversely, the addition of higher amounts of borax tends to decrease the compressive strength of the geopolymer, whereas adding a small amount of calcium oxide into the mixture increases the strength marginally, especially when the borax content is small.

Investigation of fresh concrete focuses on the optimal design of rheological properties which determines the pumpability, extrudability, and buildability.
