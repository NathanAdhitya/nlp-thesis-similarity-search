It offers many advantages such as reduced human error, minimum manpower usage, and shorter construction period. This technique, however, still needs to be studied further to ensure good quality of constructions. This experimental study aims to investigate the bond strength of embedded steel reinforcement in vibration-based 3DCP mortar. The parameters varied are reinforcement diameter and direction of printing. It is found that average bond stress decreases as reinforcement diameter increases. Furthermore, 3DCP specimens with bars placed parallel to the printing direction have relatively higher bond stresses as compared to the ones with bars placed perpendicularly. As compared to conventional cast specimens, 3DCP specimens have higher bond stresses which might be due to vibration-based 3DCP mortar. Moreover, building code formulas significantly underestimate the bond stresses of vibration-based 3DCP specimens tested in this study."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GJ1hgyYAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ced.petra.ac.id/index.php/civ/article/view/28055", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HFmbtvUXZ9EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Fly ash integrates well with cement, demonstrating favorable qualities in concrete such as good workability, high ultimate strength, and durability. However, the use of fly ash in very high proportions has not been extensively explored due to its weakness in early strength development in concrete. Methods have been investigated to enhance the early compressive strength and compressive strength of very-high-volume fly ash mortar. This research explores the incorporation of fly ash at a very high percentage (80%), also known as very-high-volume fly ash (VHVFA), into mortar using low-molarity alkali solution and thermal activation. The activation of fly ash is examined through alkali activation, specifically utilizing sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, and thermal activation involving \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GJ1hgyYAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=875098785566542008", "cites_id": ["875098785566542008"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40996-024-01553-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uMgRgbX5JAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 2, "2025": 1}}
