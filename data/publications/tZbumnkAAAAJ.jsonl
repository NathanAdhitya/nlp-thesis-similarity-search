However, standalone MR devices pose challenges related to performance and visualization realism. In this study, we focused on enhancing immersive learning by optimizing the User Interface (UI) of an MR batik-making application using the Meta-UI principle. This research aimed to assess the impact of these UI approaches on user satisfaction, measured through Nielsen's usability methods. User feedback was collected and analyzed to refine the UI design. Nielsen's usability heuristics guided the evaluation of UI attributes such as clarity, efficiency, and user satisfaction. The utilization of Meta-UI demonstrated a notable increase in user satisfaction. Nielsen's usability guidelines indicated ratings ranging from 3.93 (good) to 4.30 (very good), signifying users' positive perceptions of learnability, efficiency, memorability, error handling, and overall satisfaction within the MR batik-making application. This research also addressed these issues by meticulously optimizing 3D assets within MR applications. The results indicated that the application's CPU utilization is around 22%, attributed to its startup processes, resource allocation, and any initial computations it performed. However, the application continued to run within 4 GB of installed memory with the network bandwidth usage at 0.27 Mbps. User comfortability was enhanced, which is evident in improved ratings for importance and satisfaction levels (4.26 and 4.16, respectively) in the MR application."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "tZbumnkAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8400041165799473345", "cites_id": ["8400041165799473345"], "pub_url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c0d9/3ceeb77261a2d601f5787c221fdbe778dda1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wcAiWu_wknQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 2}}

The objective of this article is to control the movement of actuators in compliance with 3D position required by simulator. This research uses discrete actuator for 3D simulator with four actuators that is open-loop controlled using Neuro-fuzzy control system. The actuator possesses linear pneumatic actuator with three pistons inside where each piston has independent intake. With the proposed design, the actuator able to give degree of discrete not only two (binary) values but also 26 combinations of discrete values. The 3D simulator proposed in this research have four actuators and two passives like-actuator. This configuration gives 4 degrees of freedom of platform movement. Applying force to the actuator using discrete output controller make possible to get more precise in terms of control and movement of the simulator that very useful for many force control applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "tZbumnkAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18850/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9vrdW4MUT3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

The output of the Arduino is a movement command (ie. forward, backward, turn left, and turn right). The training methods of the system composed of three sets of thinking mode. First, thinking with doing facial expressions. Second, thinking with visual help. Third, thinking mentally without any help. In the first set, there are two configurations thinking with facial expression help as command of the mobile robot. Final results of the system are the second facial expressions configuration as the best facial expressions method with success rate 88.33 %. The second facial expression configuration has overall response time 1.60175 s faster than the first facial expressions configuration. In these two methods have dominant signals on the frontal lobe.
