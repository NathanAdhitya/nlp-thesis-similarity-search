Harga hand sanitizer pada awal masa pandemi menjadi relatif tinggi karena kurangnya suplai, padahal masyarakat kelas bawah tidak memiliki daya beli. Oleh karena itu diperlukan edukasi kepada masyarakat untuk bisa membuat hand sanitizer sendiri agar biayanya terjangkau. RW 09 di Kelurahan Jemur Wonosari merupakan sasaran pengabdian masyarakat yang tepat karena berada di daerah yang padat, ramai, berada di gang kecil dan level ekonomi penduduknya menengah ke bawah. Tujuan pelatihan adalah memberdayakan kelompok masyarakat setempat dengan kemampuan membuat hand sanitizer sendiri.

Over the past 3 years, there have been 30 to 35 work accidents every year. Until now the company does not have occupational health and safety management system. This final project aims to identify hazards, carry out risk assessments, and create risk control for hazards in the company's production area. After conducting research, in the production area there are 16 sub-activities with 17 potential hazards. The risk assessment resulted in a high risk rating of 4 potential hazards, significant risk rating of 10 potential hazards, and a moderate risk rating of 3 potential hazards. Risk control carried out is 9 controls with technical design, 11 administration, 9 personal protective equipment, and 1 substitution. This control has been validated by the company's implementation. If all of these controls are carried out, then the estimated risk rating is a significant risk rating of 1, a moderate risk rating of 7, and a low risk rating of 9. The implementation is carried out in the activity of chopping coconut and attaching the oven plug to the electrical installation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "kd4vOZMAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=514323533366582940", "cites_id": ["514323533366582940"], "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/13372", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nF7wUYc-IwcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3, "2024": 4, "2025": 2}}

Failure narratives of 15 entrepreneurs helped explore enabling conditions that supported post-failure to either seek new business opportunities or abandon entrepreneurship. Analysis of the responses to shame from failure, coping strategies and personality traits revealed similar patterns of personality profile, shame processing and problem coping strategies for the restarter entrepreneurs who overcame their shame. Contrarily, non-restarters who could not cope with shame and depression exhibited distinctly different patterns of personality traits and coping approaches."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "kd4vOZMAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7986177318804081945", "cites_id": ["7986177318804081945"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/03063070221081824", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GU2ZePWZ1G4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2, "2024": 4, "2025": 1}}
