Third, it describes the conceptions of various aspects of their reality. Data collection through direct observation and interviews with bureaucratic officials (Head of Service), stakeholders, academics, and online service users. The stages of data analysis include three aspects, namely interpreting data (structure and meaning of data) and data categorization/coding (variations in understanding and empirical manner), as well as formulating results (identification of conception and outcome space) and making research reports. The findings of this research show that Smart or M-Government is an Essential Necessity: The evolution toward intelligent government in the digital era is no longer a choice but a historical necessity. The convergence of technological advancements in internet-based information technology and the increasing public demands for top-tier services has made competent government imperative.
