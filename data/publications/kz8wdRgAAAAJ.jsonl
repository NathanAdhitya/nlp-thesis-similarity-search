However, creating new floorspace in dense urban areas is challenging due to a scarcity of undeveloped and brownfield sites. Alternatively, the demolition of existing buildings, to be replaced with taller examples, is increasingly criticised due to high embodied carbon impacts. Thus, the conundrum: how to increase space in cities while limiting demolition and environmental impacts? Vertical extensions (VEs) or building atop existing buildings have emerged as a novel solution to add space, while avoiding demolition of existing buildings. Despite gaining popularity globally, literature on VEs is dominated by the European context. There is limited knowledge of why VEs are pursued as a building typology, and their architectural and technical strategies globally. While reserve structural capacity in existing buildings is known as a key opportunity for VEs, there is limited research that quantifies this capacity in different building types, with different VE structures. Whilst environmental benefits of VEs are widely suggested, there is little quantification compared with conventional building types. This thesis fills these gaps and investigates if VEs can be a viable and sustainable solution to urban space shortages. This research is designed with an exploratory sequential mixed methods approach. First, interviews with developers, contractors, architects, and engineers involved in VEs, and a review of 172 built VE projects globally was conducted, to document and classify their drivers, decision-making, and strategies.
