It has also been applicable to the politics in the eastern contexts, including Indonesia. An issue that is prevalent in Indonesia at the moment is populism as an excess of democracy. Thus, there have been questions whether during President Joko Widodo\u2019s administration, populism in Indonesia has grown to authoritarianism, or another bent feudalistic, populism. On such an account, this paper is to analyze one strand of discourse studies of politics focusing on the public statements of President Jokowi in ahead of the 2024 Presidential Election in Indonesia. So, the analysis is focused on the micro level behaviors being grasped through some verbal expressions and actions against the background of multimodal discourse analysis of some obvious semiotic resources in the context of the overturned pre-existing practices of the 2024 Presidential election. President Jokowi displayed some semiotic behaviors of being \u201cmencla-mencle\u201d (destructively inconsistent) and \u201ctipu-tipu\u201d (destructively deceptive) that are definitely constitutive of destructive politics. Under van Dijk\u2019s critical discourse analysis such obvious behaviors show the reproduction of political power and abuse."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "X7y8GO8AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://proceeding-mediacon.petra.ac.id/index.php/med/article/view/8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:syLeHBdhnjQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

In other words, particular constellations of social situations tend to co-vary with a group of the linguistic subsystems of a major code called a language variety.

This variety is worth of an academic inquiry on account of its insight into the interactions between different language varieties that make it up in the speech habits of Indonesian speakers in most informal social situations. As the informal social situations demand, speakers tend to shift to the use of this style so as to create congruent situational situations.
