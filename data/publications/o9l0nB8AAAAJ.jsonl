More attention is given to the effects of that particular parenting style on the children\u2019s academic achievement and wellbeing. Listen to Me (LTM), a play by Bernadeth Febyola Linando (2018) published as one of Petra Little Theatre\u2019s New Play Development Series, indicates that the issue also hits a nerve among young contemporary Indonesian playwrights. This paper is interested in finding out how LTM portrays Tiger Mother parenting style and its impact on the children. Upon analyzing the play using the conceptual framework of parenting styles and their impacts, this paper argues that LTM displays a typical Tiger Mother parenting similar to Chua\u2019s with a slight difference, and it shows mainly negative results of such parenting on the main character, and, on the side, some positive results on two other supporting characters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "o9l0nB8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2502804354239658787", "cites_id": ["2502804354239658787"], "pub_url": "https://kata.petra.ac.id/index.php/ing/article/view/19289", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:I3vBvEy_uyIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 0, "2024": 1}}

However, that is not entirely true. Although popular literature is considered as 'nothing' compared to the canonized works by say, Shakespeare or Austen, it does convey significant issue beyond the entertainment atmosphere it offers. One clear example is The Full Monty, a novel by Wendy Holden. Under all the humor presented, it talks about masculinity issue in time of unemployment. As men traditionally, in general, attach their masculinity to the job that they have, the loss of job almost certainly violates the exercise of the traditional concept of masculinity and affects one's perspective of his masculinity - just like what is encountered by mostly three out of the novel's six main characters: Gaz, Dave, and Gerald. This correlation between unemployment and masculinity makes me eager to find out how the manifestation of the traditional idea of masculinity is affected during the time of unemployment, and further, why and how Gaz, Dave, and Gerald respond to the threat of their masculinity during that particular condition. In conducting my analysis, I am using cultural approach facilitating mainly gender theories related to traditional male role and stereotypes. In my analysis, I find that the three characters do find unemployment interrupting their exhibiting the traditional concept of masculinity by taking away or at least distracting most of their masculine roles and stereotypes. They all feel uneasy about it and display different reactions, redeeming their loss of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "o9l0nB8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13378990555382240017", "cites_id": ["13378990555382240017"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/7691/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EVPdcga5q7kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
