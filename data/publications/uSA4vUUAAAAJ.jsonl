Research on consumer experiences continues to evolve, encompassing physical, spiritual, and emotional responses to these experiences (Kim & So, 2022; Kumar et al., 2023). Additionally, the tourism industry has recently emphasized sustainability (Lee & Xue, 2020; S nchez-Fern ndez et al., 2019) and digitalization, advocating responsible and eco-friendly tourism practices while leveraging technology to enhance the tourist experience. The advent of digitalization in the tourism sector has facilitated greater access to information for tourists, enabling them to enjoy more personalized travel experiences through the Internet, mobile apps, and social media (Preko et al., 2023). Having these experiences is likely to create a vivid memory (Ahn et al., 2017; Ittamalla & Kumar, 2021) and are more inclined to revisit destinations when they enjoy unique and authentic experiences.  Therefore, the combination of sustainable and digital tourism experiences not only boosts tourists vivid memory but also positively influences their intention to revisit and recommend destinations (Lee & Xue, 2020; Preko et al., 2023). It is therefore clear that future tourism trends will increasingly emphasize digitalization and sustainability, contributing to the well-being of tourism businesses, governments, and local communities.
