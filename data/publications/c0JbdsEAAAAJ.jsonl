Using an online questionnaire administered to a diverse group of 15 international participants, we investigated how digital technologies improve visitor experiences. Our results highlight the importance of interactivity, personalized storytelling, and thematic diversity in creating meaningful and enjoyable experiences. The study shows that integrating visitor feedback improves inclusivity and accessibility in art spaces. We also provide best practices for using digital technologies in art exhibitions, offering insights into creating universally engaging experiences for visitors from different cultural backgrounds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "c0JbdsEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054825000037", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QE5pjadlgtsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Through thematic analysis of existing literature and validation via a professional survey, five key principles were identified: Human-Centered Design, Technological Integration, Narrative Fidelity, Cultural Sensitivity, and Sustainability. These principles offer a framework for preserving cultural authenticity while enhancing user engagement and accessibility. This study explores key challenges in integrating sustainability and cultural authenticity into phygital cultural heritage projects and provides cultural heritage professionals with flexible design strategies that leverage digital technologies to create immersive, educational, and culturally respectful experiences. These adaptable strategies ensure that projects remain viable, relevant, and capable of balancing innovation with preserving heritage integrity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "c0JbdsEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202435143214091.page", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xj1sHlbqqdsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Such is the case with the city emblem of Surabaya, Indonesia, which already has the iconic images of a shark and a crocodile (Suro and Boyo). As Surabaya continuously focuses on its image, art toys based on the city\u2019s symbols prove to be a potential platform and asset for engaging the public towards the city. If aligned and integrated well with tourism activities, licensing, branding, and various marketing communication media, it is a prospective resource and intellectual property for the city\u2019s public diplomacy in local and global settings.

Their popularity comes from other users watching and sharing their stories or videos to others which later on gained the attention of mass media.

Through ethnography and qualitative analysis, Gunarso achieved visual discourse for understanding a cultural phenomenon. Although he had beautifully exhibited his documentary project, it also projected several problems and issues that would be important to consider in future projects with similar conditions, especially undergraduate final projects that are confined to a single semester.
