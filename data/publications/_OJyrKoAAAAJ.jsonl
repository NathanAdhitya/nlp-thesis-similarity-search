To bridge this gap, SparkFlow was developed with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness. Built on top of Spark, a well- known Big Data framework capable of processing data promptly and efficiently, SparkFlow features visual block programming that allows non-technical users to easily create data analysis workflows. SparkFlow's elements then convert these workflows into Spark operations for execution on the underlying cluster.

ARI consists of various diseases and has a very varied possibility of symptoms. If not detected and treated immediately, ARI can get even worse and can lead to death. With an expert system, users can quickly self-diagnose without worrying about the cost or time required. The knowledge possessed by the expert system also comes from doctors in their fields. The expert system will be built with the help of 2 (two) methods, namely the forward chaining as an inference method and the certainty factor as the calculation method. With the forward chaining method, the system can provide information such as what disease the user is suffering from directly after the user fills all the questions that will be asked by the system. In addition, with the certainty factor method, the system can provide information \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "_OJyrKoAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4597973338249570411", "cites_id": ["4597973338249570411"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4597973338249570411&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aygV2WNIzz8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2, "2024": 4, "2025": 2}}

The method used to classify topics and sentiments is the Naive Bayes Classifier. Data will be prepared through preprocessing, by eliminating the same sentence, changing abbreviated words, stemming, and stop word removal.

Experiments demonstrate that KEQA outperforms other question answering methods. Despite having high accuracy, KEQA still uses simple and outdated embedding method.
