Companies must now  use technological assistance and data processing to produce faster and more efficient business processes. Our case  study is using HDPE Plastic Company, which is in Surabaya, is trying to handle the increasing frequency of shipments.  Due to the rising frequency of shipments, the company is often overwhelmed in handling its loads because no system  can quickly determine the shipping route.     Moreover, other route-determining factors, such as shipment weight, truck capacity, and unique delivery hour requests,  manually add to the routes complexity. The system will run the K-Means cluster function from the database to cluster  all customers in the company. This cluster is one of the factors determining the fitness value in the Particle Swarm  Optimization (PSO) algorithm. After the order data is obtained, the system will use the PSO algorithm to determine the  delivery agenda for each truck. The determining factors of PSO include customer location, priority hours of customer  requests, order weight, and loading capacity of different types of trucks. After obtaining the delivery table of each  truck, the system will use the help of Google Directions Service to determine the routing order from each truck.    The result of this system is a delivery route optimization system that can provide route selection recommendations for  each truck in the company. The system is also able to sort shipments with various shipping priority restrictions. From  the test results, the PSO algorithm in the system can produce routes with less total distance traveled and less travel \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "timN0XcAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/21224/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2qd7lHFyW5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

In contrast to ordinary static computer programs, machine learning programs are programs designed to be able to learn on their own. Machine learning technology has been widely applied in various fields, including in chemistry. Currently the introduction of basic chemical objects is a study that has many concepts that are easy for beginners to understand and imagine, such as atomic structure and molecular shape in chemical bonds. So that an alternative learning media is needed in order to improve understanding of the concept of chemical objects interactively. Machine learning technology is expected to provide a more realistic interaction and is an advancement of a promising technological method that can motivate users to engage in a more active learning system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "timN0XcAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/990/1/012001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:na9Ed1tvHpkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Bladed weapons are selected because of potential applications in the real world. The trained models are YOLOv2-tiny, YOLOv3-tiny and YOLOv3. Transfer Learning is done to these models with Darknet so that YOLO can detect the desired weapon. Darknet model will be converted to Tensorflow Lite. Model testing is done by looking at some standard accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, mAP, and the average IoU.
