Upaya pendinginan pasif dengan ventilasi alami sering kali tidak efektif karena suhu tinggi, kelembaban, radiasi matahari, serta kecepatan angin yang tidak mendukung. Sedang meningkatkan kecepatan angin akan mengganggu aktifitas. Salah satu solusi untuk pendinginan adalah dengan memindahkan panas udara ke tanah, atau dikenal sebagai Earth-to-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE). Penelitian ini merupakan eksperimental studi lanjutan untuk mendapatkan optimasi model EAHE di siang hari di Surabaya. Hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa EAHE efektif menurunkan suhu ruang hingga 2\u00baC. Angka ini cukup signifikan untuk dipakai sebagai pendinginan ruang. Kajian lebih lanjut diperlukan untuk menentukan kebutuhan udara dingin yang proporsional dengan volume ruang."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SXZUyLYAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ejournal.itn.ac.id/index.php/pawon/article/view/12533", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3qINnTGx5PcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

In this experiment, there are three models used. The first is the greenhouse (called GH1) with cooling water flowing at the outer surface of greenhouse periodically. The second is a greenhouse (called GH2) without a cooling system and the third is in the open space or natural farming. A water sprayer is installed in each model to water the plants. It sprays periodically. In each greenhouse, three temperature and humidity loggers are installed to measure the air temperature and humidity.

Water has high thermal conductivity and specific heat but is corrosive, creating a mineral build-up that causes scaling. Additionally, its high freezing point presents operational challenges. Vegetable oils emerge as a promising alternative, owing to their lower freezing points. In light of environmental concerns, researchers are exploring vegetable oils as substitutes for petroleum-derived mineral oils. This paper is intended as an initial study using vegetable oils, i.e. coconut and sunflower oil, as the heat-transfer medium in aquifer thermal energy storage. The experiments assess the heat-transfer coefficient of coconut, sunflower, mineral, and synthetic oils when exposed to the same heat source.

By lowering the inlet air temperature as much as 4C for the compressor, the CO2 emission could be reduced around 4000 kg/year.
