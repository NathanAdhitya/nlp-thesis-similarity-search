X uses 20 hot press machines to produce the facings. The required heating process is provided by heat transfer oil (HTO), which is heated by natural gas burned in a heater. PT.

The assessment started with checking the insulation on the piping system, measuring the temperature in the hot press machines, and measuring the HTO flow rate. The insulation in the piping system is in good condition. From the measurement, it was found that the HTO flow rate is adequate and fits the need of the heating process. Another finding is that the surface temperature of the lower plate in shaft no. 4 is the lowest than in the other shafts. The existing (asbestos) insulation from the lower bed in shaft no 4 to the hydraulic component is only 3 mm thick. This is not enough to prevent heat loss from the bed in shaft no. 4. The new 18-mm asbestos replaced the old asbestos. The replacement shows that the temperature at the mold surface at shaft no. 4 increased from 162.6 C to 170.9 C on average for MC-02 and from 166.7 C to 173.1 C on average for MC-03.

The experiments were conducted in a room with opened \u2013 and \u2013 closed door. Instead of using liquid desiccant, the experiment used solid desiccant, i.e. silica gel which thickness were 6 mm and 8 mm with density equals to 1.27 gr cm\u20133. From the experiment, it is found that (a) the thicker the silica gel, the higher outlet air temperature from silica gel, (b) less condensate will be produced when the silica gel used is thicker, (c) silica gel is suitable for reducing humidity of outdoor/fresh air, and (d) the electricity consumption saving for inserting 8 mm silica gel is only 4 % when the door is closed and 31 % when the door is opened."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SXZUyLYAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7421442938905225868", "cites_id": ["7421442938905225868"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18546/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jOpGTghD_mYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}

The impeder used in the welding machine needs to be cooled to maintain its temperature below 35oC. The cooling fluid is water with 2% cutting oil and called coolant. It should enter the impeder at 15oC. The required flow rate is as much as 30 lt/min. To ensure the impeder s temperature be kept lower than required temperature, then the heat exchanger shall be designed to cool the coolant from 40oC to 15oC. Air-cooled water chiller type UWAP750AY3 is used to produce chilled water needed by the heat exchanger. The 5/8-inch-finned-copper pipes are used as tubes in the heat exchanger. The coolant is divided in four equally tubes from a header. To meet the heat transfer area needed, each tubes will be bent to make 10 passes (or rows). At the end of the last row, four flow will be gathered in a header. Then, the coolant will circulate to impeder with the required temperature. Numerical simulation was conducted to get the velocity vector and temperature distribution of flow inside the tube, and also the pressure drop of the flow across the tubes and header. Velocity vector of flow around return bend, flow in entrance and exit are interesting. They give understanding that the pressure drop will be higher in such accessories than in straight pipe. The pressure drop of coolant flowing inside tubes of heat exchanger is 5143.2 Pa from analytical solutions and 4611.4 Pa from numerical simulation using Fluent. Temperature of coolant at outlet got from numerical simulation is almost the same with the designed temperature, i.e. 15oC. So, the numerical simulation reinforces the design of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SXZUyLYAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18297/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xRnhdRjPMr8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

The survey was done via reflection they wrote in the end of the process. The students learn not only heat transfer itself, but they also learn how to apply it to an oven needed by a community in Kebontunggul, a small village in Mojokerto. The students in three groups visited the village, discussed with the villagers, and designed the oven used to dry crackers  paste made from corn, cassava, and rice flour. Once the design was ready, the students went to workshop to manufacture the ovens. The oven was tested before sent to the village. They learned that it was difficult to make those cheap crackers. They learned a lot from the villagers in social interpersonal, social intrapersonal, emotional, and cognitive process. They are thankful to God for their being and grateful for this Service Learning class. A student even wrote, I had changed motivation from just pursuing grade to seriously helping villagers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SXZUyLYAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18322/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vr9W34NWLkcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Many factors that contribute to wire drawing die wear, one of them is temperature of the wire during drawing process. Therefore, die cooling system have to be considered to reduce die wear. Water that is cooled by cooling tower is usually used as die coolant. If the heat is not transferred well to the coolant, then the die wear will happen faster and the die needs replacement more often. ASM International gives suggestion to maintain the die gap or the wire\u2019s temperature at 137oC during drawing process. At this temperature, die wear will be 0.01 mm for 500 km of drawing wire that contains 0.08% Carbon. In a wire company that produces AISI 1010, wire was drawn from diameter 5.5 mm to 4.75 mm and die wear was 0.05 mm for 332.1 km of drawing wire. This die wear showed the existing die cooling system was not enough.
