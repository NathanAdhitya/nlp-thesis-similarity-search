The optimal process variables for xylan hydrolysis by free enzyme and immobilized enzyme were found to be at pH of 5.0 and xylan concentration of 2.50%(w/v).

The low-fat and high-protein content of skim coconut milk makes it a healthier alternative to regular coconut milk and cow milk. This study compares ultrasonic-assisted pasteurization of skim coconut milk to conventional pasteurization technique in terms of contamination reduction efficacy and energy efficiency with minimum product characteristic change. The process consisted of thawing frozen skim coconut milk, homogenization of liquid skim coconut milk and pasteurization in a shaking water bath or ultrasonic bath.

The study showed the removal efficiency of ultrasonic-assisted pasteurization and conventional pasteurization at 70 C and 15 minutes were 28.74% and 12.33%, respectively.

The increased demand for energy will increase the price of fossil fuel, global warming, environmental pollution, and the fast-diminishing supply of fossil fuels because they are nonrenewable.

Biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, FAME) is a renewable clean energy, as it can be produced from renewable resources such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and microalgae oil. Biodiesel can be considered one of the promising renewable fuels currently produced on an industrial scale [4]. Biodiesel can be blended with petrodiesel, and therefore requires practically no changes in the fuel distribution infrastructure [5].
