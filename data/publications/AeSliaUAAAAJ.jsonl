The study employs a descriptive qualitative approach, with the object being the representation of women empowerment and the subject being the film The Little Mermaid. The findings reveal that the women empowerment exhibited by Ariel, the protagonist of the film, is articulated through three categories: women empowerment in making life choices, achieving equality in society, and fostering social change. These categories align with the stages of women empowerment, personal level, interpersonal level, and social action & social change. Furthermore, it is evident that the depiction of a woman with a special status, such as a double minority, can empower individuals with similar statuses who view the film.

For this reason, intercultural communication competence is really needed. Moreover, when asked what would bring more joy to their lives in future, vacations came out on top for Gen Z, highlighting the importance of travel and adventure for this generation. Thus, the opportunity for Gen Z to meet many people with diverse cultural backgrounds becomes very large. This study was conducted to photograph the extent of intercultural communication competence currently possessed by Gen Z. Research used an interpretive or constructive paradigm with a case study method. Researcher conducted a study on how 10 (ten) Gen Z people interact with people from different cultures with them.
