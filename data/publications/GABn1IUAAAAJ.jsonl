Having dreamt of exactly the same thing twice, he wants to have his dreams come true. He is eager to find the hidden treasure that was shown in the Egyptian Pyramids in his dreams since he has the faith he will not be able to be happy and peaceful, unless he could find the hidden treasure. Using the literary philosophy theory on transcendentalism, particularly Emerson\u2019s theory written in McKinnon\u2019s (1985) book, this article discusses how nature can help Santiago in his process of finding the real happiness, namely the hidden treasure, in his life. Though he has to undergo a great deal of difficulties, threats, and dangers in his effort to find the treasure, he eventually succeeds in finding the treasure; namely the girl he loves dearly and his own happiness."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GABn1IUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7630497840006639647", "cites_id": ["7630497840006639647"], "pub_url": "https://www.kata.petra.ac.id/index.php/ing/article/view/18142", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HzD7fFv55GkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}

The theories used to analyze were Bierman and Assali\u2019s (1996), King\u2019s (nd) and Stanlick\u2019s (2003). The findings showed that there were five types of argument structure used: serial, linked, convergent, divergent, and hybrid argument structures. The linked argument structure was the argument structure used the most frequently in Hillary\u2019s utterances in the debate, while the divergent was the least one. Thus, it could be concluded that Hillary\u2019s speech in the Presidential Debate was quite interesting since she could combine all the five types of argument structure, though the frequency of using them was not the same and it seems that linked argument structure was the most effective strategy for her in arguing about the politic, economy, and social issues."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GABn1IUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11306441751789664591", "cites_id": ["11306441751789664591"], "pub_url": "https://www.kata.petra.ac.id/index.php/ing/article/view/17894", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T3kRgd6M6JwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
