When viewed from the aspect of the customer, the user needs a system that can facilitate the user in meeting the need to wash, both in terms of time efficiency, and the affordability of the place. When viewed from the aspect of the laundry owner, the laundry owner needs a system that can be a bridge between the user and the owner, so that the laundry owner can enter a wider market. So when viewed from these two aspects, both parties need a concept or system that connects the two parties, namely the concept or marketplace \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "K8Ze1_QAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13554723888072468633", "cites_id": ["13554723888072468633"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13554723888072468633&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:magPaY8NHLwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1, "2024": 0, "2025": 1}}

Therefore, this research uses CNN Residual Network (Resnet) with 4 augmentation technique on both geometrical and non geometrical batik pattern. This research use (Resnet) as a main architecture of CNN to identify batik pattern. Batik motives for this research are from geometric category which is ceplok, kawung, lereng, nitik, and parang. And from nongeometri category are semen and lunglungan. Furthermore, the dataset will be applied scale, random erase, rotation, and flip augmentation to increase the quantity and variation of batik dataset. The results show that CNN Resnet with data augmentation on training dataset gives accuracy up to 84, 52% on Resnet-18 and 81, 90% on Resnet-50. furthermore \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "K8Ze1_QAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11536194588748197482", "cites_id": ["11536194588748197482"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11536194588748197482&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aq4eatvLGKAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 5, "2024": 9}}

This research was conducted to make it easier for a doctor and a relative of a person with heart problems to conduct surveillance in Real Time. The Arduino device will read each sensor and by using services from ThingSpeak and IFTTT, data readings can be received and visualized, then automatically recorded on Google Sheets so that they can be accessed either via the internet or mobile applications.
