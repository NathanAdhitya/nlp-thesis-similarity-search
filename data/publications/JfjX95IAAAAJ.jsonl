Existing studies on remanufacturing mostly focus on operational issues, product acquisition, and pricing. However, some doubts about remanufacturing business arise in developing countries, where there is less regulation on remanufacturing and less environmental awareness. This study aims to investigate the prospects of remanufacturing business from the retailers perspectives through in-depth interviews on three retailers in Surabaya, Indonesia. The main drivers for mobile phone remanufacturing business are its affordable and competitive price, big demand for popular mobile phones and high-end mobile phone, the opportunity for specification upgrade, and its suitability with the needs of Indonesian people. The main barriers for remanufacturing business are the possibility for cannibalizing new mobile phones market share, the uncertainty of core supply, discontinuity of replacement part supply, lack of product knowledge among consumers and retailers, hesitation of retailers to sell remanufactured products, and lack of strict and clear regulations about remanufacturing business. Findings of this study provide insights to prospective mobile phone remanufacturers of what needs to be tackled to start a prosperous business. On the theoretical side, it provides complementary knowledge to existing studies that have been conducted mostly on countries that have higher environmental awareness."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JfjX95IAAAAJ:eO3_k5sD8BwC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8623434359798254302", "cites_id": ["8623434359798254302"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18577/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3kqsf9yXrHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 0, "2024": 0, "2025": 1}}

This paper aims to design a mobile phone remanufacturing process in Indonesia. Indonesia is a developing country where mobile usage is quite high. The mobile phones are chosen because it is one of the biggest e-waste takers of late. Several factories were visited in this study. This research uses a qualitative survey, which is carried out in mobile phone factories and service centers. From this research, a design has been made to remanufacture the process on mobile phones. The manufacturing plant verifies the design to obtain the input of the real constraints which will happen when the remanufacturing process is done. The steps in the process of remanufacturing are human machine interface & visual inspection, separation, disassembly, cleaning, inspection, sorting, reconditioning, reassembly, and final inspection."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JfjX95IAAAAJ:BrOSOlqYqPUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10640142644961170124", "cites_id": ["10640142644961170124"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18576/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zFJlmFxhqZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2025": 2}}

Rapid innovation in technology accelerates obsolescence and hence product life cycles are getting shorter and wastes build up faster. Remanufacturing of short life-cycle product is an important alternative to mitigate the waste. However, since there are impacts in implementing remanufacturing, such as cannibalization, segmentation, and lower willingness to pay, pricing has become a significant aspect to ensure successful remanufacturing business. Several studies show that there exists green segment consumer, who has higher preference to purchase environmental-friendly products and higher willingness to pay for such products.
