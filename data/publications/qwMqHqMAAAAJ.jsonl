Data penelitian diperoleh dengan menyebarkan kuesioner kepada kontraktor, manajemen konstruksi, tim owner/developer, dan akademisi di Surabaya. Metode pendekatan yang digunakan yaitu pendekatan tradisional (analisis deskriptif mean) dan pendekatan berbasis monte carlo simulation yang mendukung prioritas risiko dan bisa mengidentifikasi risiko dengan probabilitas dan dampak yang rendah hingga tinggi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan hasil data memiliki nilai yang kurang lebih sama dan tidak ada risiko yang terletak di zona eksposur berisiko tinggi. Namun, usulan penentuan model direkomendasikan menggunakan pendekatan metode monte carlo simulation karena memiliki keuntungan yang lebih baik menggunakan simulasi dalam menguji data sehingga hasilnya jauh lebih mendekati keadaan sesungguhnya dan tidak dapat menyebabkan beberapa risiko kritis terabaikan."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qwMqHqMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-sipil/article/view/12919", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gscb_yAIL_8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

The structural engineer always try to find the optimal structure design with minimum cost that satisfy the safety requirement. This safety requirement can be expressed as structural reliability that associated to a certain failure probability threshold. An integrated Reliability-based Design Optimization (RBDO) framework usually employed to minimize the cost objective function subjected to the failure probability limit. Failure probability mostly computed by using a time-consuming Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. This study develops two hybrid RBDO framework, SOS-ANN and PSO-ANN, which combine the metaheuristic method, Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with a machine learning method, Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The SOS and PSO method are used to solve the discrete optimization problem. The ANN method is adopted to replace the MCS method in predicting the reliability of every solution using binary classification. A practical RBDO case of steel truss structure is used to demonstrate the performance of both SOS-ANN and PSO-ANN method in finding the optimal structural design. The results show that the SOS-ANN method outperforms the PSO-ANN method in terms of solution quality, computational efficiency and consistency."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qwMqHqMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10542324409353646782", "cites_id": ["10542324409353646782"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19381/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vjJ01jHcTZIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2025": 1}}

Since the target failure probability is usually small, it takes long computation time to perform Monte Carlo simulation for accurate estimation. In the literature, surrogate models have been created to replace the time-consuming reliability analysis. The process of RBDO would include three parts: perform sampling in the solution space, build a surrogate model based on the concept of data mining, and use the surrogate model to perform the reliability analysis.

The aim is to examine the performance of these data mining method in predicting the failure probability when new designs are found during the process of optimization. The present study addresses two cases of RBDO where reliability is treated as the constraint or treated as an additional objective function. In the former case, the data mining methods are used to identify whether a design leads to failure. In the latter case, the data mining methods are applied to estimate the probability of failure. Because the probability of failure may be expressed in different forms (exact value, logarithmic scale, or safety index), we also investigate whether these forms would influence the estimation accuracy.
