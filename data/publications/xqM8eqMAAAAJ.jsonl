This  research  aims  to  see  how  family  and  institutional ownership influence the relationship between tax risk and tax avoidance as  moderating  proxies.  The  study  was  conducted  on  manufacturing companies listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange between 2016 and 2020. Thirty-six  companies  were  selected  as  the  sample  using  the  purposive sampling method. This quantitative research used Ordinary Least Square. The results show that family ownership can strengthen the relationship between tax risk and tax avoidance, while institutional ownership fails to moderate.    Family    shareholders    significantly    influence    company management  when  selecting  how  to  utilize  the  tax  risk  connected with each  business  strategy.  Family shareholders  prioritize  the  protection of the company s image over maximizing profits with high risk"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "xqM8eqMAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9019046455220437200", "cites_id": ["9019046455220437200"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19684/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0AApUPcWKn0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3, "2024": 3}}
