This responsibility places significant demands on teachers to guide students through the complexities of academic writing. This paper explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into the research writing process as a solution to these challenges. It examines various AI applications that support content generation, literature review, data analysis, editing, and citation management. While these tools offer substantial benefits in enhancing students writing skills, the paper emphasizes the critical role of teachers in ensuring responsible use of AI. Practical instructional strategies are provided for teachers to effectively incorporate AI tools at different stages of writing, such as brainstorming, drafting, refining clarity and style, managing references, ensuring originality, and analyzing data. The conclusion highlights that although AI tools are valuable assets in research writing, teachers remain essential in guiding students to use these technologies critically and effectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "fylFCeEAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/21571/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FRklpV-d-GEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

The findings further demonstrate that mutual engagement in these groups extends beyond simple information exchange, fostering collaborative learning and reflective practice among teachers.
