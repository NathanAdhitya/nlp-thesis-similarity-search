The company considers the single drop inefficient since the usage of small trucks is significantly higher than that of larger trucks. Therefore, it is  essential  to  change  finished  goods  previously  delivered  using  small  modes  of transportation to large ones. Since customer demand cannot be controlled, increasing the truck size could be achieved by merging several destinations in a truck (multidrop), reducingtransportation  distance.  The  problem  of  determining  the  optimal  route  to reduce the delivery route distance by considering the vehicle capacity is included in the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows(CVRPTW), which can be solved  using  Anylogistix.

X is a company engaged in the manufacturing of heat exchangers. PT. X has a standard time formula for each process on the production floor. The washing process formula currently only uses three variables from the specifications of each unit. The research carried out at PT. X aims to see whether the standard washing process standard time formula is still relevant or not to be used today. Observation data shows that the average time of 105.88% of the results of the calculation formula is greater than the actual time. The results of the calculation of the new formula are designed to approach the actual time and only use two of the seven factors that significantly influence the washing process time based on the ANOVA test results. The new standard time formula was built using a regression model. Standardizing the washing process using a new formula can reduce the washing process production costs by 39.8% from\u20ac 0.1008/minute to\u20ac 0.0607/minute."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "g6QF95YAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/12753", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LVCpi_Q7G_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

This company is expanding the consolidator building where the goods handling process is carried out. Along with the expansion of the consolidator, company wants to design a sorting room layout that can minimize the occurrence of missroute goods and increase the effectiveness of the process at the consolidator. Company also wants to evaluate the needs of its operational and administrative workforce. The design of the consolidator layout is done by taking into account the number of destinations of the sorting room, the amount of aisle needed, and the amount of sorting space based on the volume of goods. The layout design produces 3 sorting areas with a total of 115 sorting rooms. Evaluation of workforce needs is done by work sampling and calculation of full time equivalent. The determination of operational workforce needs is then followed up with a process simulation with the help of standard time calculations. The result of the calculation is to reduce 3 workers who are projected to be able to reduce labor cost by IDR 100.811. 501,-annually for the company."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "g6QF95YAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/12670", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XsmWOYS-icsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
