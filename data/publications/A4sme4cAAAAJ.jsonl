Thus, there have been questions whether during President Joko Widodo\u2019s administration, populism in Indonesia has grown to authoritarianism, or another bent feudalistic, populism. On such an account, this paper is to analyze one strand of discourse studies of politics focusing on the public statements of President Jokowi in ahead of the 2024 Presidential Election in Indonesia. So, the analysis is focused on the micro level behaviors being grasped through some verbal expressions and actions against the background of multimodal discourse analysis of some obvious semiotic resources in the context of the overturned pre-existing practices of the 2024 Presidential election. President Jokowi displayed some semiotic behaviors of being \u201cmencla-mencle\u201d (destructively inconsistent) and \u201ctipu-tipu\u201d (destructively deceptive) that are definitely constitutive of destructive politics.

Students resist through micro-resistance by questioning the system and rules, and through strategic, tactical, and counter-conduct resistance by protesting the system and rules. The analysis shows the school establishes control by informing and threatening students, and by intimidating and punishing them. To resist, students question the rules in the conversations with friends and the headmaster, and protest by breaking the teacher\u2019s metronome and complaining to the government.

For such reasons, all the elements of narrative structure are held to be obligatory.

This research used qualitative approach to analyze the compliment responses performed by the lecturers. The compliment responses were analyzed based on Robert K. Herbert (1986)\u2019s theory. It was shown that the responses given are various. The lecturers are most likely to accept compliments by appreciation token, both in verbal and non-verbal responses. Moreover, most of the responses are combination of two or more types of CRs. In relation to gender, male and female participants give similar responses, yet male tend to use question preceding or following the responses, while female tend to use comment avoidance. Regarding the L2 (Second Language) competence, this study found out that the lecturers still retain their L1 (First Language) culture in appreciating a compliment, regardless their competence in English, both linguistically and culturally. In conclusion, the variety of compliment responses given by lecturers of English at the English Department UNIBRAW might be caused by their habit of expressing themselves freely without too strictly bound to the norm in which they are related.
