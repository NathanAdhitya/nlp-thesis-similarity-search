The research aims to read the ideal female body on the packaging design of jamu and to reveal the ideology behind them. We analyzed the packaging designs of jamu related to the formation of female body produced by five major manufacturers of traditional medicine that have survived for at least three generations: Air Mancur, Sido Muncul, Jamu Jago, Nyonya Meneer and Jamu Iboe. This analysis uses Roland Barthes' semiotic theory that reveals the linguistic message, the denoted image and rhetoric of the image.
