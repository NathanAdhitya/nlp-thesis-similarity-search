Using qualitative research methods, the researchers collected and analyzed the data. The results indicated that the types of figurative language found in Genshin Impact were simile, analogy, metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, personification, and allusion whereas simile, analogy, metaphor, metonymy, personification, and allusion were found in Honkai: Star Rail. Synecdoche, personification, and the combination of metaphor and synecdoche were absent in Honkai: Star Rail.

The least frequently used is withhold politeness, which might happen because although Sylvie is a generally nice person, she uses clearer impolite strategies to Emily on purpose.

Afterwards, the implementation was evaluated as a part of classroom-based research and reflective teaching. This article focuses on our evaluation and reflection on the implementation of HBLT in classrooms.

Using Shulman\u2019s knowledge bases of learning (1986), this paper investigates the importance of pedagogical content knowledge based on teacher cognition and reflected on teaching practice. In a pilot study conducted in a Strategic Marketing in Education Business class in a private university in Surabaya, classroom observation and interviews were conducted to find out the techniques used to create effective learning environment. The finding suggests that questioning becomes an instrumental tool in increasing students\u2019 participation and achievement. The aspects of questioning will be discussed extensively as part of teachers\u2019 personal practical knowledge. This initial study will serve as a foundation for a larger scale research to look at the transition from personal practical knowledge to pedagogical content knowledge."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "U9CAW70AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/16545/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ur--dYGrQkcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

The writer observed five young male leaders of five different street dance groups in making request to the male and female members in the meeting. The writer used the theory from Trosborg (1995) to classify the request uttered by the leaders. He found that the leaders mostly used the same request strategy, which is direct strategy to both male and female members in the meetings. The result also showed that the leaders used more indirect strategies, such as mild hints to the female than the male members probably because the leaders tried to be more polite to the female members."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "U9CAW70AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://katakita.petra.ac.id/index.php/sastra-inggris/article/view/436", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HqguVrszxUoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
