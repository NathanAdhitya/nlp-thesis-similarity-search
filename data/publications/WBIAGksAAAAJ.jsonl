So that the content creators are competing to produce video works that can be enjoyed by YouTube users. Various methods are used by content creators to improve the quality of the video produced. The process carried out in this thesis is the process of processing raw data that has been collected from YouTube, before the training and classification process. The process of data preprocessing needs to be done to overcome the raw data that is varied and inconsistent so that it can affect the training process and the classification process. Data preprocessing conducted in this thesis includes Tokenization, Stopwords Removal, Stemming. The classification process is the process by which the classification algorithm is run on comments that are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WBIAGksAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13768944975675935984", "cites_id": ["13768944975675935984"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13768944975675935984&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8EwQH4EeFb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 8, "2024": 5}}

To overcome this problem, an online store application is created that can make sellers and buyers communicate with several kinds of media to communicate. The feature is that the seller can receive and send messages to the seller through several social media options available, for example Whatsapp. And in order to maintain the security of buyers when transacting websites using payment gateway services from Midtrans that provide payment methods including card payments, bank transfers, direct debit, e-wallet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WBIAGksAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2234453017221442184", "cites_id": ["2234453017221442184"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2234453017221442184&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iKrINi5fAh8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1, "2024": 2}}
