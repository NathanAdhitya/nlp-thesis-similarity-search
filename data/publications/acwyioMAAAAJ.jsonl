This experimental study aims to investigate the bond strength of embedded steel reinforcement in vibration-based 3DCP mortar. The parameters varied are reinforcement diameter and direction of printing. It is found that average bond stress decreases as reinforcement diameter increases. Furthermore, 3DCP specimens with bars placed parallel to the printing direction have relatively higher bond stresses as compared to the ones with bars placed perpendicularly. As compared to conventional cast specimens, 3DCP specimens have higher bond stresses which might be due to vibration-based 3DCP mortar.

The strength of the concrete fc varied from 80 to 100 MPa.  The fiber content Vf varied from zero to 1.2%.  Two different values of flexural reinforcement ratios \u03c1 (= As/bd) of 0.9% and 1.4% were chosen for this test program.  The experimental results showed that the use of double hooked-end steel fibers in the concrete enhances slab performance significantly in many ways.  As the fiber volume or fiber content Vf   increased, the flexural stiffness of the slab throughout loading history also increased, while both the deflections and crack widths decreased considerably.  At the ultimate load stage, the punching shear strength increased by up to 156% compared to non-fibrous concrete slabs.  The increase in punching shear strength is significantly higher than the increase introduced by conventional single hooked-end steel fibers.  The ductility of the slabs was also significantly improved. Comparisons between design methods with experimental results show that the design method by Concrete Societys TR-34 performs very well.  Another method that was based on the yield line theory overestimates the strengths of the slabs.  Model Code 2010 method also overestimates the punching shear strengths.  Finally, some relevant design recommendations are given."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "acwyioMAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11989168650051778699", "cites_id": ["11989168650051778699"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18126/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i_iVql0VYqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 4, "2024": 5, "2025": 2}}

Numerous researches have been conducted to study its nonlinear behavior via microscopic and macroscopic model. The later approach is currently being widely explored since it has many advantages compared to the preceding models. A well-known macroscopic model, namely Shear-Flexure-Interaction Multiple-Vertical-Line-Elements-Model (SFI-MVLEM) in the open source platform Open Sees, is capable of simulating the coupled nonlinear shear-flexure interaction response in the RC wall. This paper presents an evaluation to the applicability of SFI-MVLEM model to predict the coupled nonlinear shear-flexure behavior of RC wall specimens compared to experimental results in available literature. The analysis results show that the model is able to predict the behavior of RC wall considerably accurate in terms of hysteretic curves, cracking patterns, and contributions of shear and flexural displacement to total displacement."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "acwyioMAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=785579473874636505", "cites_id": ["785579473874636505"], "pub_url": "http://ced.petra.ac.id/index.php/civ/article/view/20649", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2c4ii17w5goJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 0, "2024": 1}}

However, due to the complexity of wall behaviors and possible loading combinations that they may be subjected to, it is quite challenging to derive a method that is reasonably simple but can accommodate various influencing parameters in order to acquire more accurate predictions of wall shear strengths. The authors had earlier tested a series of very-high-strength concrete wall specimens (fc\u2032 = 100 MPa [14,500 psi]) to investigate the influence on shear strength of several parameters, such as: height-to-length ratios, shear (web) reinforcement ratios in the vertical and horizontal directions, as well as the presence of flanges (boundary elements). The conclusions of the authors\u2019 experimental study in the light of other research results reported by other researchers will be summarized herein and will be used as a guide for deriving a proposed truss model. The proposed model is based on modern truss analogy principles (softened truss model, compression field theory) and it has been shown by comparing it with experimental results to be accurate and stable. The design and analysis procedure based on the proposed truss model will also represent an improvement over existing ACI and Eurocode design procedures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "acwyioMAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3611495470244869977", "cites_id": ["3611495470244869977"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18125/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Wbfg4_6bHjIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2, "2024": 4, "2025": 1}}

Parameters investigated are wall height to length ratio, vertical and horizontal web reinforcement ratios, and presence of boundary elements. The experimental results show that the shear strength of RC walls is greatly affected by wall height to length ratio. Furthermore, both vertical and horizontal web reinforcement have contribution to the shear strength of RC walls and their effectiveness depends on wall height to length ratio. In addition, presence of boundary elements can increase significantly the shear strength of RC walls. Analytical models have been developed based on truss analogy to predict shear strengths of RC walls. Data from past experiments on RC walls and from this study are used to verify the accuracy of the proposed models. Furthermore, building codes and other analytical model predictions are included as well for comparison. The analysis results show that the proposed models are more accurate than building codes and other analytical models. They have lower coefficient of variation values as compared to other predictions.

The parameters included were height-to-length ratio of the walls, vertical and horizontal web reinforcement ratios, and the effects of boundary elements in the form of flanges. The experimental results show that shorter walls exhibit greater shear strength than taller walls. Both vertical and horizontal web reinforcements contribute significantly to increasing the shear strength of the walls, with the horizontal web reinforcement being more effective for walls having height-to-length ratio from 1.0 to 2.0. With increase in height-to-length ratio of walls, the concrete contribution to the shear strength decreases while the web reinforcement contribution increases. The presence of flanges also significantly increases the shear strength of HSC walls. Experimental wall shear strengths from this study as well as from literature were compared with predictions from the ACI Code and Eurocode provisions. It can be seen that both ACI and Eurocode do not give consistent safety factors.
