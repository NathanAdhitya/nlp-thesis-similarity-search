Furthermore, the paper also investigates the possible reasons for any similarities or differences in the results of the three sectors.This paper measures the impact of the stock market sectoral index price (SIP) by using the daily closing price as a dependent variable. In addition, this study uses three independent variables: geopolitical risk (GPR), commodity price (CP) and foreign exchange rate (FER). Seventeen countries from the G20 are analyzed using a daily timeframe from September 2021 to August 2022 (before and during the Russian invasion).The results revealed that FER, CP and GPR all affect SIP, but the level of significance and positive/negative signs vary in all three sectors. The positive FER affects SIP in all sectors \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-KoeN4wAAAAJ:jL-93Qbq4QoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=663335071213460209", "cites_id": ["663335071213460209"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/SEF-05-2023-0218/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8Zq8lrujNAkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2025": 2}}

Additionally, examines BT as a moderating variable between ESGD and operational efficiency in the banking industry. The results revealed that BT positively affects OE. Moreover, one ESG pillar, governance (GOV) has a significant influence on OE. In terms of the moderation effects of BT, this paper shows that BT could moderate the relationship between social (SOC) and governance (GOV) on OE. The applications of BT have proven to benefit firms in information transparency, financial performance, and stability, hence creating operational efficiency. This paper contributes to the roles of BT, whether as an independent or as a moderating variable that could strengthen the relationship between ESGD and OE.

The data spans 2018 to 2024, including customer reviews from TripAdvisor. com and Google Maps Local Guides. The results indicate that CX significantly enhances OSAT at all quantiles of overall satisfaction but only significantly affects WOMM at 0.80 quantiles of WOMM. These findings indicate a diminishing marginal utility of customer experience at higher satisfaction levels. This study reveals the importance of enhancing customer experience to improve overall satisfaction and subsequent Word-of-mouth Marketing across different levels of customer satisfaction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-KoeN4wAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ijoi-online.org/attachments/article/520/1406%20Final%20revised-1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tPLBgwVeYYcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
