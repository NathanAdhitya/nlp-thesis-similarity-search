Circular economy initiatives have become important in the last few decades, and one of them is extending product life by reusing discarded products. On the other hand, triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, online learning has become an essential part of education. In Indonesia, marginalized communities or low-income societies have limitations in providing online learning tools such as desktop or laptop computers, including smartphones. Therefore, smartphone donation is considered a suitable initiative to help students who need a smartphone to join online learning while at the same time extending the useful life of a smartphone. Using decision tree techniques, we investigate the willingness to donate used smartphones for education in the Indonesian context.

Pemerintah terus berupaya untuk meminimalisir penyebaran dari virus ini, salah satunya dengan kebijakan pembelajaran daring untuk pelajar. Kebijakan ini menjadi kebiasaan baru di kalangan pelajar dan menuntut pelajar untuk mampu beradaptasi. Kebiasaan baru pelajar untuk melakukan pembelajaran secara daring merubah kebiasaan tidur dan mempengaruhi kualitas tidur pelajar. Kualitas tidur akan berdampak terhadap performansi pelajar pada bidang akademik. Kualitas tidur yang buruk menyebabkan sulit untuk berkonsentrasi, menjadi lebih emosional, dan menurunkan tingkat produktivitas. Sampel penelitian terdiri atas 200 pelajar siswa Sekolah Menengah Atas dan Mahasiswa Strata 1 yang melakukan pembelajaran daring yang berdomisili di beberapa daerah di Jawa Timur. Pengambilan sampel menggunakan metode purposive sampling. Pengukuran kualitas tidur menggunakan kuesioner Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) dalam Bahasa Indonesia, dan disebarkan secara daring dalam bentuk Google form. Pengolahan data menggunakan statistik deskriptif dengan tabulasi silang dan statistik non-parametrik dengan uji beda Mann-Whitney Test. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan 72, 5% responden memiliki kualitas tidur buruk. Penelitian ini juga menunjukkan bahwa kualitas tidur tidak dipengaruhi oleh jenjang pendidikan dan durasi penggunaan gadget, namun dipengaruhi oleh jenis kelamin dan durasi tidur pada malam hari."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KXrEBfAAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14976584322896118844", "cites_id": ["14976584322896118844"], "pub_url": "https://sentekmi.maranatha.edu/index.php/sentekmi2023/article/view/51", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PETooheE188J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2, "2024": 2}}

Pak Dedik dahulu pernah bekerja di proyek konstruksi bagian pengelasan, dimana beliau belajar mengelas secara otodidak dan menyukai pekerjaan tersebut. Karena lokasi proyeknya semakin jauh dari tempat tinggal keluarganya, Pak Dedik memutuskan untuk berhenti. Beliau sempat ikut bekerja dengan orang tuanya di pasar malam dan mencoba membuat odong-odong sebagai salah satu hiburan di sana. Kegemaran dan bakatnya mengelas pun mendapat perhatian dari orang-orang sekitarnya sehingga Pak Dedik mulai menerima pesanan dan memutuskan untuk membangun bengkel di rumahnya. Selain Bengkel Dedik Kris, Pak Dedik juga menyediakan odong-odong dan kolam pancing ikan magnet di pasar malam.Kreasi-kreasi barang Pak Dedik sangat banyak. Beliau selalu mendapatkan permintaan dari tetangga-tetangga di dusunnya, namun sering ditolak karena keterbatasan tempat. Beliau mengaku dapat membuat pagar, alat pengangkat galon, mobil odong-odong, kanopi, tempat penjemur pakaian, hingga wahana memancing ikan magnet yang biasanya dibawa ke pasar malam. Pesanan-pesanan ukuran besar pun diterimanya, seperti tiang tandon, pintu lipat, dan jembatan gantung.

Currently, the number of workers in production department are 22 workers. The improvement of work standards are made based on observations and job descriptions of each worker by considering production capacity and physical distancing health protocols. Determining the optimal number of workers in some demand conditions are done using Macro Excel and done by minding the production capacity and limits on the number of people in one workspace according to WHO recommendations. Application of Macro Excel program is done by counting 2 examples of existing cases. The first example has demand percentage of 77.05% and the optimal number of worker is 17 workers and the second example has demand percentage of 13.02% and the optimal number of worker is 12 workers.
