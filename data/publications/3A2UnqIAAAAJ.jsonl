Although it is continuously produced and sold as regional specialties of Madiun, East Java, most people refuse to consume this solid brem due to its high sugar content and lack of information that describes its potential health benefits. The present study is attempting the possibility of combining glutinous rice with another local food material having well-known health benefit. Here, we utilize the potency of local purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas var.

The raw materials were subjected to yeast fermentation for 7 days, and subsequently extracted using manual mechanical press. A series of materials ratio (extract of fermented glutinous rice: purple sweet potato= 30: 1, 15: 1, 15: 2) was determined prior to dehydration of brem, and then the color, sugar content, pH, antioxidant activity, and sensory properties of the resulted product were analyzed.

The tea dregs from six commercial teas, consisting of green and black teas, were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a photodiode array detector, and the spectroscopic data were analyzed from 350 to 700 nm.

Although the dregs of black teas generally contain fewer remnant pigments, they possess residual chlorophyll b, which is not found in the dregs of green teas.
