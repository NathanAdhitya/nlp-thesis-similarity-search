The partial least square technique analyzed data from as many as 115 respondents, with the position as senior staff level and higher, who have worked for at least two years and are permanent employees. The results showed that the implementation of eco-design has an impact on green purchasing and green manufacturing.

Internal changes are encouraged to adapt to external conditions. Partnerships with external parties through supply chain collaboration are needed to improve supply chain performance and increase competitiveness. This research examines the effect of supply chain collaboration on supply chain performance by adopting new product development, product knowledge, and production technology. The study surveyed 148 manufacturing companies at managerial level using questionnaires. Data processing using SmartPLS software version 4.0. The results show that supply chain collaboration positively influences production technology, product knowledge, new product development, and supply chain performance. Production technology positively impacts product knowledge, new product development, and supply chain performance. The results also show that supply chain performance is influenced by product knowledge and new product development. In addition, production technology, new product development, and product knowledge mediate the indirect influence of supply chain collaboration on supply chain performance. This study contributes to enriching supply chain management theory. The practical contribution is to enlighten the companys managerial to run supply chain collaboration in generating performance and competitiveness."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "9kiTNVMAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8535893534212203815", "cites_id": ["8535893534212203815"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/20270/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J6VFu_GVdXYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2, "2024": 6, "2025": 2}}
