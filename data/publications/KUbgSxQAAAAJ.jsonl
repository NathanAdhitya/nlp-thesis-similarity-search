Therefore, in this study, customers of Online Store X were segmented based on their transactional behavior using online transaction history data from March 2021 to March 2023.

The optimal number of clusters (k) is then determined using the Elbow Method. The results indicate that the optimal number of clusters for both combinations is K= 3, with the combination of MLRFM and RM K-Means is the best combination.

It takes a means of transportation that can answer the needs of the community. Currently, online transportation is an option in answering public transportation needs. The uniqueness of the online transportation business is that passengers can place orders anytime and anywhere. On the other hand, the driver can also be active/available anytime and anywhere. This causes problems in fulfilling orders, providers must consider various factors such as the time and distance of the driver to get to the pick-up location in determining which driver is assigned to fulfill the order. This study simulates order assignment using the Hungarian method, Minimum Value of Selected Factor in Data Collection, and random assignment. From the test results, it is known that the highest average pick-up duration and pickup distance are obtained using the random \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KUbgSxQAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9384557005596130150", "cites_id": ["9384557005596130150"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10041526/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zvv1BOCkPIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1, "2024": 1, "2025": 1}}

In this research, the Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) method was used to classify loyal customers. Based on this classification, drivers are appointed to fulfill orders from passengers (order matching). The method used to pair drivers and passengers is the Hungarian method.

The number of people who have started to implement online buying and selling activities in their daily lives has resulted in an increase in the number of reviews on e-commerce.
