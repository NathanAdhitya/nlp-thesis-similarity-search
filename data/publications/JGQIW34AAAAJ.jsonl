The final number of samples is 68 firm-years. This research found that customers\u2019 satisfaction can enhance customer loyalty while also significantly improving customer advocacy. However, the performance of the Indonesia Original Brand Index still not significantly impacted financial performance. This issue happened due to the excessive resources of Indonesian companies, which spent on turning customers' loyalty and be advocates for the brand. This unfavorable profitability outcome can also be due to the unique characteristics of Indonesia\u2019s consumer behavior. According to 81% of IOB respondents, Indonesia\u2019s customers prefer to buy things at a low price and economically. With this behavior of seeking the lowest price, it indicates that customers in Indonesia may shift from one brand to other brands to get the best offer available, therefore not resulting in their constant purchase of one specific brand."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JGQIW34AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15832326233670066316", "cites_id": ["15832326233670066316"], "pub_url": "https://journal.ipb.ac.id/index.php/ijbe/article/view/29591", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jKAAhtO4t9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1, "2024": 1}}

Tourists visit tourism destinations in search for the destination experience as well as the culinary experience. Indonesia which is rich of various kinds of local traditional food in each of the tourist destination place has become an attraction for the domestic tourists to visit different tourist destination places to enjoy both the destination experience and the local food. There have been many previous studies discussing the concept of experience quality and tourist satisfaction in the context of culinary tourism; however, these variables have not been linked to destination experience. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of culinary experience quality on destination experience satisfaction in Indonesia, with culinary experience satisfaction as a mediating variable. The respondents of this study include 401 domestic tourists who travelled to one of the four gastronomy destinations of Denpasar, Solo, Bandung and Yogyakarta participated in the survey. The findings showed that the positive culinary experience of domestic tourists in Indonesia significantly influenced overall destination experience satisfaction, which in turn, led to positive behavioural intentions. Moreover, the finding also showed that food is the most influential factor in creating the culinary experience of the domestic tourists."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JGQIW34AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2935610421630650610", "cites_id": ["2935610421630650610"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18571/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8sg6_B9ivSgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 0, "2024": 2}}

VAIC method by Pulic was used in measuring the intellectual capital in this research. Based on VAIC approach, intellectual capital consisted of human capital (HCE), structural capital (SCE), and capital employed (CEE). There were ten regression models used to assess all the relationships of independent and dependent variables. The result showed that VAIC had significant relationship towards financial performance but not towards the market value of the companies. While in regards to each component, HCE was found to have no correlation towards both market value and financial performance. The SCE was found to have a negative significant relationship only towards the market value.
