In Chinese Department, Petra Christian University the teacher education program does not provide the students with teaching practice since teacher education is only a minor. Due to this condition, the teachers use movies in order to give exposure, motivation and reflection on how to be a good teacher.

These movies can help them to have a clear description on the complexity of becoming good teachers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "k925b70AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/16337/1/III.A.2.a.1.1_Kinds_of_teacher_-_UKSW.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jc9T8eZCEAsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
