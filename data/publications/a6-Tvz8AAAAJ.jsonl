To identify the most effective regressor, we propose a comparison framework to evaluate the performance of several types of regressor models. This evaluation will include Neural Networks, Boosting and Bagging Ensembles, and a baseline assessment using a linear regressor family. In this study, we implement the grid search method to improve model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters, as does the K-fold shuffle split cross-validation method. We consider large spatial and long temporal historical datasets for the case study. A 5 km x 5 km gridded hourly temporal-based 1 MW modelled Solar PV dataset consisting of direct and diffuse irradiation, temperature, and power output during 2013-2022 in the Java-Bali region, Indonesia, is used as a case study. The grid search-optimized Neural Networks family, the Multilayer Perceptron model, can accurately predict power output from short-, medium-, and long-term horizons, with an average MAE of 0.248 kW and an average RMSE of 0.306 kW, followed by Random Forest, a grid search optimized Bagging Ensemble and a grid search-optimized Histogram Gradient Boosting Ensemble model. All predictor models generally performed well under strong El-Nino-affected data but were sensitive to very strong El-Nino during 2015-2016.

Several issues arose in a setting where each speaker's comment regarding the discussion topic must be noted for further manual and thorough analysis. Due to the sheer volume of the speech data and the limitation of available manpower, the assigned annotator for a given discussion frequently lost focus and became unable to take accurate note of each speaker's comment, resorting to paraphrasing. The paraphrasing caused a loss of information, context, and personal bias that prevented an objective evaluation. This study intended to address the issue and is conducted to objectively retrieve the comments contributed by each discussion member regarding a given topic and utilise unsupervised learning to nd and identify anomalous comments. In particular, comments that are not appropriate to the topic of the discussion become the focus of this study. To this end, we propose a feature extraction and anomaly detection pipeline. The obtained text corpus will have its features extracted with word embedding and topic modelling. The extracted features will then become input for the anomaly detection methods: density-based clustering (DBSCAN), Isolation Forest (IF), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF).

Preliminary results show that these features can provide good results for all datasets tested. Detailed analysis of the results, however, reveals the existence of class imbalance issues for two of the bigger datasets - there is a high imbalance between the accuracies of different classes (e.g., 7.73% for the fake class and 99.3% for the genuine class using a Multilayer Perceptron classifier).

This act undermines the trust of buyers in product reviews, and potentially reduces the effectiveness of online markets. Being able to accurately detect fake reviews is, therefore, critical. In this study, we investigate several preprocessing and textual-based featuring methods along with machine learning classifiers, including single and ensemble models, to build a fake review detection system. Given the nature of product review data, where the number of fake reviews is far less than that of genuine reviews, we look into the results of each class in detail in addition to the overall results.

This paper aims to provide a foundation by building a machine learning model across multiple techniques to predict psychological distress from ecological factors alone.

Determining the parameter settings of ensemble models, however, is not easy. Besides its own parameters, an ensemble model has base-predictors that have their individual parameters. Some ensemble models use a specific base-predictor and could be optimised using standard metaheuristics such as the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) approach. Optimising ensemble models with multiple base-predictor candidates is more complicated and challenging, as there are multiple options to choose from. We therefore propose Multi-Level PSO (ML-PSO) and Parallel ML-PSO (PML-PSO) to optimise the parameters of ensemble models, especially those with multiple base-predictors, for sentiment analysis. The idea is to utilise multiple PSOs as particles of the main PSO.
