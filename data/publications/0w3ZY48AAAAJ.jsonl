The results of the analysis show that brand experience has a positive influence on satisfaction, brand trust, and loyalty. The higher the user's perceived brand experience, the higher the level of satisfaction, trust, and loyalty to the Samsung brand. Satisfaction has also been proven to positively impact loyalty, where high satisfaction increases user loyalty to Samsung smartphones. In addition, brand trust plays an important role in building customer loyalty, where higher trust in a brand will increase the customer's tendency to remain loyal to using the product. The managerial implications of this research highlight the importance of building user communities on social media to increase customer engagement through sharing positive experiences regarding Samsung features. In addition, effective communication with customers must continue to be strengthened to provide education and resolve various obstacles faced by users, so as to strengthen trust and loyalty to the Samsung brand."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "0w3ZY48AAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ojs-isei.petra.ac.id/index.php/jrem/article/view/27", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SxL4IkgHgjcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Supply chain management practices are the ways to improve the competitive advantage, particularly in the global competition context. However, there is still doubt SMEs can compete globally, considering they face limited resources, skilled workforce, and business networks. Therefore, this study aims to examine the influence of supply chain management practices, covering cross-functional integration, partnership, responsiveness, and resilience. Moreover, this study has examined which practices dominate in improving competitive advantage. The quantitative study involved 445 SMEs located in East Java, Indonesia. The respondents are supervisors or higher levels and work in departments related to supply chain management, as they can provide the relevant information and possess complete knowledge of management practices. The data were collected via a questionnaire designed with a five-point Likert scale. The responses were analyzed using SmartPLS software 4.0. The results show that cross-function integration improves supply chain partnership, responsiveness, and resilience (\u03b2= 0.705, 0.382, 0.324; t-value= 25.177, 6.697, 5.783).

Moreover, supply chain responsiveness improves supply chain resilience and competitive advantage (\u03b2= 0.285, 0.106; t-value= 5.690, 2.099).

Hence, top management commitment is highly needed to maintain eco-friendly products and contribute to the company's performance. This study examines the role of top management commitment to operational performance through adopting information technology, supply chain integration, and green supply chain management. This study surveyed manufacturing companies that have implemented ISO 14000, as many as 73 companies with criteria of having more than 100 employees. Data is collected using questionnaires directly and online with Google Forms. The results of data processing analysis found that top management commitment influences information technology adoption with a priority scale to maintain competitiveness and strategies that increase competitiveness.

Research respondents consist of employees or unit leaders who are competent in the substance of the survey. Data analysis uses the partial least square (PLS) method. The results showed that digital technology positively and significantly impacts supply chain collaboration, inventory management, and supply chain resilience. The company's ability to build supply chain collaboration impacts improving inventory management optimization, supply chain resilience, and supply chain performance. Furthermore, inventory management with the ability to control inventory well and on-time delivery does not impact supply chain resilience. However, good inventory management has a positive impact on supply chain performance. Likewise, shipping companies, by increasing supply chain resilience, have an impact on supply chain performance.
