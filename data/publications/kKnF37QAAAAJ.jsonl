Employing partial lease analysis is to predict model parameters and results of several closed survey questions to validate statistical findings with a total of 351 Indonesian high school students as the respondents. These millennials  intention to choose the accounting major is positively influenced by their attitudes toward the accounting profession; their self-efficacy; and their supporters (the subjective norms).

The questionnaire was collected from 309 respondents from the five largest internet user areas: Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Semarang, and Medan. This study executes the research framework using binary logistic regression. The results reveal that intergroup bias and overborrowing are the most impulsive factors contributing to the cryptocurrency investment decisions over the past year. Furthermore, after November 2021, Indonesian crypto owners are more irrational in a bearish period since their investment decisions are driven by their desire to be accepted in the social group. Moreover, when they have overindebtedness, instead of solving their debt problems, they prefer to spend their money on cryptocurrency investments. The subjective norms\u2019 influencers suggest that crypto owners not invest when the cryptocurrency price is sharply declining.

The research data were obtained through a questionnaire-based survey of several manufacturing companies in Indonesia that implement ABC systems. This research used the Structural Equation Model with Partial Least Square statistical method. The results of this research indicate that those companies who apply an ABC system are capable of making their pricing strategy more effective and increasing their competitive advantage. The empirical results show that price competition is unavoidable among manufacturing industries. However, implementing an ABC system can increase manufacturing companies competitive advantage. Thus, the implementation of an ABC System employs pricing strategy as a determinant factor of competitive advantage. This research supports the results of previous studies that also concluded that there is a strong relationship between ABC systems and competitive advantage. In addition, this research found that pricing strategy can improve competitive advantage with implementation of an ABC System."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "kKnF37QAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13042150385837823477", "cites_id": ["13042150385837823477"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19823/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9VUW96wG_7QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2025": 1}}
