Traditionally, villainesses were depicted as undesirable antagonists as they did not fit into the frame of traditional femininity or were merely viewed as sexually attractive. However, the traditional aspects of femininity were now contested by the villainess protagonists. Utilizing Butler\u2019s theory of gender performativity along with Kress and van Leeuwen\u2019s visual analysis, the protagonists\u2019 and antagonists\u2019 thoughts, actions, and appearance were analyzed. A descriptive qualitative analysis was conducted on two webtoons, The Villainess Reverses the Hourglass, and It Looks Like I\u2019ve Fallen into the World of a Reverse Harem Game. The studied data are selected from chapters 1-45 in each webtoon. The results show that the villainess protagonists are depicted as more independent, have more power, and occasionally dress in a masculine way, while the heroines-turned-antagonists are illustrated as a dependent, lack power, and always dressed femininely. In this case, the heroines-turned-antagonists\u2019 traits represent Korea\u2019s traditional notion of femininity. Meanwhile, the villainess protagonists possess traits opposing the heroines\u2019 traits. Positioning the villainesses as protagonists and heroines as antagonists show a clash of modern vs. traditional notion of femininity, and putting the \u2018villainesses\u2019 as the desirable protagonists imply how their representation of femininity is considered more favorable in the modern context."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3bis8a0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14436760594729317595", "cites_id": ["14436760594729317595"], "pub_url": "https://journal.binus.ac.id/index.php/Lingua/article/view/8375", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:27QyjEWtWcgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 1}}

Interestingly, celebrities or influencers are not the only ones using it. Gen Z also uses Instagram to present their image as ideal as possible. However, that  does  not mean  they  lose  their  true  identity.  This  generation  prefers  to  have multiple Instagram accounts to express themselves. This study aimed to explore why Gen Z had multiple Instagram accounts, how they chose the followers, and how they conducted online  self-disclosure  through  content  categorisation  of  each  account. Through this study, the researchers wished to contribute a deeper understanding ofthe  cyber-self,  particularly  in  communication.
