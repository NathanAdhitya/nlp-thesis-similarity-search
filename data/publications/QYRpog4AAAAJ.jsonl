With over 430 anime production studios in Japan, Studio Ghibli has emerged as one of the most popular anime studios. Its popularity is partly due to its exploration of themes related to humanity and environmental issues, including war. Reflecting on the fact of how the film has served as a medium to criticize the war, Studio Ghibli confidently implied it in some of its films, one of which is Grave of the Fireflies (1988). This thesis goes beyond recent studies that focus solely on fireflies as symbols of wartime conditions. The broader symbolism used in Grave of the Fireflies will be analyzed to see the impact of war in physical and mental aspects before and after the war. By applying symbolism in war film theory to analyze physical and mental aspects, it shows the characters\u2019 struggles, fears, aspirations, and sacrifices through symbols that appear throughout the film. Moreover, the findings indicate that all of the symbols used in this film have evolved into two opposing conditions: hopefulness and hopelessness."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "QYRpog4AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://katakita.petra.ac.id/index.php/sastra-inggris/article/view/14535", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mcglAYORsQQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

One of the visible changes in wedding is the commodifica-tion of its ceremony, which is heavily propelled by social media. In this article, through an ethnographic study of Chinese Indonesians living in Surabaya, I ana-lyze how their wedding ceremonies expose the negotiation of their ethnic, social, and cultural identities. Primary data, gathered from interviews, are analyzed using affect theory. The findings show that because of the historical trajectory in which Chinese tradition and culture were banned when the New Order regime was in power and revived after the fall of the regime, as well as the increasing popularity of social media in which consumption in weddings is pictured, their wedding ceremony and rituals are in a cultural nexus where the ceremony and rituals are still influenced by traditions, yet at the same time they undergo changes because of growing new cultures. The social media that portray ideal weddings increase the intensity of the affective elements of wedding ceremonies, which jump from one individual to another. Their wedding ceremonies are awash with elements suffused with their projected ethnic, social, and cultural identities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "QYRpog4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nTzBEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA144&dq=info:bEXeusPNOxkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=udLLwB9mmm&sig=KCqN55vfjuLwhKP1NxCskoC1QhY", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bEXeusPNOxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Melalui media sosial, orang menunjukkan beragam identitas mereka, yang bisa tidak kongruen dengan identitas mereka di dunia nyata. Hal ini terjadi karena media sosial itu menyediakan wadah bagi mereka untuk mengkurasi dan memamerkan apa yang mereka lakukan setiap hari dengan mengunggahnya di sana, serta merefleksikan makna yang ingin mereka tampilkan melalui unggahan mereka tersebut. Dalam makalah ini, dengan menggunakan teori intermedialitas, yang berdasarkan pemikiran dari Rajewski yang menyatakan bahwa intermedialitas itu merupakan suatu konsep semiotik-komunikatif, serta pemikiran Herkman yang menyatakan bahwa intermedialitas merupakan satu pendekatan yang  sesuai untuk menganalisis konsekuensi dan dampak sosial dan budaya dari perkembangan teknologi media, penulis mencoba mengeksplorasi artikulasi identitas masyarakat melalui unggahan mereka di media sosial. Analisis penulis menunjukkan bahwa artikulasi identitas di media \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "QYRpog4AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/20189/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i4j9fu3oj1UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

One common method adopted by some companies is using a video advertisement, which contains the message they want to convey about their product or brand. This message is intended to persuade people who see the advertisement to buy their product. In doing so, companies usually use the visual, linguistic, spatial and other semiotic resources, often referred to as a semiotic mode. Through the case study of Innisfree s video advertisement  Brand History,  we analyze how Innisfree uses linguistic, spatial, and visual mode for creating a message that enables consumers to remember and to persuade them buy its product. Our findings show that the message in the video advertisement is that Innisfree is a beauty product that upholds nature as its ingredients, has high quality, and preserves the environment where it takes its ingredients."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "QYRpog4AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6460712639439025137", "cites_id": ["6460712639439025137"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/20190/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8bOjTeoPqVkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 1}}

Product placement (PPL) is one of such innovative ways. PPL has become popular in marketing communication because the promotion in it is quite subtle. It happens because in PPL, the advertisement is integrated in the structure of the narratives of TV series or films where PPL takes place. Thus, PPL can skirt the negative view toward advertising. In this study, we examine how PPL convey advertising messages in Korean drama, Guardian: Great and Lonely God (Goblin). In so doing, by using multimodal theory we analyze the verbal and non-verbal communication practices found in some scenes of the Korean drama, and the meaning of PPL semiotic resources in those scenes express. Our findings show that PPL conveys the advertising messages through the acting, the facial expression, and the shot of products."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "QYRpog4AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16547587091076794740", "cites_id": ["16547587091076794740"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18912/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dMl4VcnWpOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2, "2024": 0, "2025": 1}}

After being suppressed under the Suharto regime, Chinese Indonesians suddenly had an opportunity to express their cultural heritage in their own ethnic media, counter negative stereotypes and reconstruct an identity that had been virtually erased during the Suharto era. In this article, author examines the discursive practices Chinese Indonesians use to remould their ethnic identity through an analysis of the media strategies used to reinvigorate the Chinese Indonesian identity. It was found from the Chinese media, as exemplified in Qiandao Ribao, Guoji Ribao and Yindunixiya Shangbao, that the re-creation of the Chinese identity requires an understanding of what it was to be Chinese through the use of the symbols most salient to Chinese ethnicity. The media have been strongly geared towards the reconstruction and maintenance of a Chinese identity that sees Chinese Indonesians as an imagined community whose ethnicity is symbolically perceived and maintained through frequent exposure to the ethnic media. By being exposed to the ethnic media, Chinese Indonesian readers can feel a sense of ethnic belonging and identity through perceived affiliation and shared symbols. However, although they succeeded in bringing Chinese culture back to the Indonesian public sphere, the diversity in the Chinese community challenges the media efforts to construct a definitive Chinese identity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "QYRpog4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12066980768592613596", "cites_id": ["12066980768592613596"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/20191/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3NBuTxOHdqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 0, "2024": 3}}
