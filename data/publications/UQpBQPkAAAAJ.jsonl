The results prove that hedonic browsing has a significant influence on flow experience. Flow experience has a significant influence on cognitive experience and affective experience as well as online impulsive buying. Cognitive experiences have significant influence on online impulsive buying. However, affective experiences do not have a significant influence on online impulsive buying. Moreover, financial management behavior cannot moderate the relationship among cognitive and affective experiences as well as online impulse buying. Theoretically, the study shows that irrational consumption processes lead to hedonic shopping due to easy and convenient searching for products through social media.
