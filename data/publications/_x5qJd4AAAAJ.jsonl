Route optimization is essential for improving the efficiency of the company in the face of increasingly intense business and industry competition. In this study, a multi-objective approach is used, considering both demand and distance factors. The proposed evaluation model utilizes a modified minimum spanning tree (MST) with probabilistic calculations based on historical data. The modification takes into account probabilistic factors derived from past data, enabling better decision-making. Additionally, for scenarios where the route needs to return to the depot, the Christofides algorithm is employed. The Christofides algorithm is used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the objective is to find the shortest path that visits all points and returns to the starting point. This algorithm is based on the MST. The results of the conducted case studies using this model show an improvement in the performance of shipping routes, with a 1.13% increase in ship utility and a 2.83% decrease in total distance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the evaluation model for shipping routes, employing a multiobjective approach, modified MST with probabilistic considerations, and the Christofides algorithm, can provide more efficient solutions and opportunities for operational improvements in the company."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "_x5qJd4AAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11988197227773445136", "cites_id": ["11988197227773445136"], "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/13612", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EETCytyhXqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 2}}

The proposed model is the modified Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem to address the pickup and delivery problem. The approach utilizes transition probability to consider the company's historical route generation experience. It also combines distance and demand between ports to handle the two objective functions. This model can create beter routes and vessel allocations with respect to total distance and average ship utility, as indicated by the comparative analysis. Implementing the model with demands at the homebases in Jakarta and Surabaya reduced the total distance by up to 1160 N. Miles and increased average utility by 20% from the previous routes. However, the model only proposes using ships according to the efficient number for operation and is currently limited to the process of only one homebase. The current model has been automated into a program that functions as a decision support system for the company to determine the best or near-optimal routes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "_x5qJd4AAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/13618", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mIKYnimdNlQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
