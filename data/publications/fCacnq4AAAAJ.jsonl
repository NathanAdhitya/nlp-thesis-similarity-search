Therefore, an application is needed to support the students in the process of starting their freelance services. The system proposed will be designed in the form of a mobile application that functions as a platform to provide various services offered by freelancers. Using this application, business owners will be directed to the academic community, where students can become the main actors as freelancers so that they can apply the knowledge gained during lectures, develop portfolios, and add work experience.

This problems are often found in college activities. Detection of student faces uses the Face Recognition library as a mean of validation in the attendance check process. Face recognition requires face images that have been preprocessed and uses the K-Nearest Neighbor model (KNN) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) to validate student faces in the attendance check process. Testing on 15 sample face images with 40 total face classes yields an average accuracy of 99%. Face Recognition cannot detect faces if the facial features are obstructed. This validation of student attendance successfully uses Face Recognition to minimize cheating in taking attendance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "fCacnq4AAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5060412791792918789", "cites_id": ["5060412791792918789"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5060412791792918789&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BeGod58yOkYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2, "2024": 2}}

The whole of a group work is only seen from the results and accuracy in the collection. In fact, in addition to results and timeliness, teachers also need to know the process of each individual to understand their level of ability. Looking at the background of the problem, an application is designed that improves individual performance control in project work or group assignments. This application will use a special framework to solve control problems, and can manage project work management to make it better. Applications will be created using the PHP programming language and MySQL as a database. The results obtained from this application include the creation of a working website with a framework for project control to regulate existing work processes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "fCacnq4AAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=375780469913062640", "cites_id": ["375780469913062640"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=375780469913062640&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8IyyrlgKNwUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1, "2024": 2}}

Purpose of this research was (1) to determine mitigation strategies of Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy amid Covid 19 pandemic,(2) to learn the adaptation strategy of community ecotourism to survive amid Covid 19 pandemic and (3) to analyze the implication of Covid 19 epidemic on ecotourism destination resilience in Papua. The research was qualitative research with descriptive explanation, and data collections used interview, documentation, literature study. SWOT analysis method to analyze strength, weakness, opportunity and threat of resilience ecotourism in Papua. The procedure of data analysis techniques in this research used (1) data reduction,(2) presentation data,(3) conclusions. The result of this study showed there were three adaptation strategies (1) physically (2) economically, and (3) social. Covid 19 pandemic gives big implicated to the economic sector, social and culture sectors on ecotourism destination resilience.
