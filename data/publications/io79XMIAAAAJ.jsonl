A huge number of design variables and complex constraints have contributed to the complexity and nonlinearity of the problems. Mathematical programming and gradient-based search algorithms cannot be used to solve nonlinear problems. Thus, researchers have extensively conducted many experimental studies to address the growing complexity of these problems. Metaheuristic algorithms, which typically use nature as a source inspiration, have been developed over past decades. As one of the widely used algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been studied and expanded to deal with many complex problems. Particle swarm optimization and its variants have great accuracy in finding the best solution while maintaining its fast convergence behavior.

The method in this research was carried out the right photogrammetric technique and processed to provide a 3-dimensional appearance. Also, sonar tools use as benchmarks with high accuracy in the bathymetry mapping and river sedimentation occurrence. The outcome of this study proves that the watershed at the study site was a tidal influence on the condition of the highest high water level, which caused seawater to pass through the river bank as high as 10 centimetres. Fur further to overcome this problem, it recommends to do dredging of the riverbed, and the appropriate construction of river banks/embankments are higher and more durable."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "io79XMIAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19265/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ij19Ama4-QUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Dalam penelitian ini, variabel yang diteliti adalah pengaruh dari densitas arus dan kadar bubuk grafit pada epoxy. Bubuk grafit berperan sebagai conductive pigment untuk meningkatkan konduktivitas epoxy sedangkan densitas arus mempengaruhi besar perlindungan yang diberikan pada spesimen. High corrosion level (mass loss teoritis 18%) diberikan ke semua spesimen beton bertulang dan CFRP laminate ditempelkan pada spesimen tersebut dengan menggunakan 5 macam kadar grafit: 7, 5%; 10%; 12, 5%; 15%; 17, 5%. Selanjutnya, ICCP dengan 2 macam densitas arus (10 dan 20 mA/m2) diberikan pada spesimen. Half cell potential test dilakukan untuk mengukur efektifitas dari sistem ICCP tersebut. Sistem ICCP berhasil memberikan kenaikan potensial minimal pada spesimen sebesar 177 mV yang menunjukkan peluang korosi pada semua spesimen semakin mengecil.

One of the significant current discussions is the reliability aspect of structure design in addition to optimal design. This problem becomes more important especially in sizing and shaping optimization of truss structures. To address the problem, this paper applies Reliability-based Design Optimization (RBDO) by combining Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and metaheuristic algorithms which are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Barebone PSO (BBPSO). The presence of uncertainty is modeled using LHS and the reliability constraint is added to measure the probability of structural failure. This study aims to investigate the performance of these metaheuristic algorithms in optimizing the structure design while still satisfying the reliability constraints. Two case studies, a welded beam design problem and 15-bar planar truss problem, are used in this study. The performance of these two algorithms will be compared. The obtained results indicate that BBPSO has a better performance than PSO."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "io79XMIAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/18852/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R5XlBghsBXQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
