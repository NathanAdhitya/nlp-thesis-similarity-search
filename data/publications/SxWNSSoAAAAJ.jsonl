The weak fuzzy similarity relation is considered as a generalization of fuzzy similarity relation in representing a more realistic relationship between two objects in which it has weaker symmetric and transitive properties. Since the conditional symmetry in the weak fuzzy similarity relation is an asymmetric property, there are two distinct fuzzy similarity classes that provide two different fuzzy coverings. The generalization of fuzzy rough sets approximations is discussed based on two interpretations: object-oriented generalization and class-oriented generalization. More concepts of generalized fuzzy rough set approximations are introduced and defined, representing more alternatives to provide level-2 interval-valued fuzzy sets.

To improve this condition, then Wang introduced the dynamic fuzzy logic. In this concept, the membership degree of a fuzzy set is changing over time. Intan and Mukaido [5] introduced the knowledge-based fuzzy set, by means that the membership degree of a set is dependent on the knowledge of a person. Since the knowledge of a person is not static, the knowledge-based fuzzy set can be measured dynamically over time, so that we have the knowledge-based dynamic fuzzy set. In this paper, we approximate the learning process as a knowledge-based dynamic fuzzy set. We consider that the process of learning is dependent on the knowledge of a person from time to time so that we can model the learning process is a Markov process of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SxWNSSoAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12198955725169721183", "cites_id": ["12198955725169721183"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-6861-5_29", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X391ZZllS6kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 0, "2024": 0, "2025": 1}}

That membership degree is represented gradually as a real number in an interval [0, 1]. Wang et al. [2] generalized the concept of fuzzy set, called dynamic fuzzy sets (DFS). In the DFS, each membership degree of an element is given by a membership function dealing with time variable. Thus, the membership degree of an element in a given dynamic fuzzy set might dynamically change according to the time\u2019s variable. In 2002, Intan and Mukaidono [3] proposed an extended concept of fuzzy set, called knowledge-based fuzzy sets (KFS). In the KFS, the membership degree of an element given a fuzzy set is subjectively determined by a single knowledge. The membership degree of an element with respect to a given fuzzy set may be different provided by different knowledge of persons \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SxWNSSoAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=160624319073746264", "cites_id": ["160624319073746264"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-6861-5_25", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WP2tmPemOgIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
