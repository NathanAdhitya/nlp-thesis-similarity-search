Therefore, this community service aims to apply biogas technology to utilize cow dung waste as an alternative energy source, improve environmental cleanliness, and reduce household expenses. Community service activities include socialization of biogas technology, training on use and maintenance, as well as installation and evaluation assistance. As a result, biogas technology was successfully implemented, meeting cooking gas needs, reducing household costs, and producing organic fertilizer.

However, ammonia still has its drawbacks, such as a high autoignition temperature, slow burning velocity, and low heating value, that demand further investigation of its combustion characteristics. This experiment was done to study the effect of nozzle shape and equivalence ratio (\u0278) on the combustion of an ammonia/oxygen/argon mixture using a constant volume combustor equipped with a sub-chamber. The fuels were premixed for 10 minutes and conditioned to an initial pressure of 0.2 MPa and an initial mixture temperature of 423 K.

To further investigate the burning characteristics of ammonia, this study is conducted for ammonia/gasoline co-combustion using a modified engine equipped with a sub-chamber.

The results show that the earlier injection timing allowed better premixing between the air and fuel mixture, thus enhancing the overall combustion characteristics. For the later injection timing, the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions decrease at the higher ammonia energy ratio due to the denitrification of the nitrogen oxides (DeNOX) process.

In several studies, briquettes have become one of the alternatives used to deal with this problem. However, the selection of briquette material that considers its impact on economic, social, and environmental aspects has not been widely carried out. To solve this problem, the selection of raw materials for briquettes must be determined using the concept of sustainable product development (SPD). SPD is a concept that can be used to determine a new product by considering various aspects, including economic, environmental, and social aspects. Briquette fuel that is derived from leaf waste and rejected fruit as a binding agent can be an alternative to renewable solid fuels since the raw materials come from wastes that have no selling value.

To substitute the fossil fuels with a more sustainable options, alternative fuels, such as carbon-free ammonia has been gaining worldwide attention. To allow the application of ammonia in internal combustion engines, its performance as an engine fuel need to be investigated. Ammonia as fuel has some  shortcomings that can be outlined as slow combustion rate and corrosion due to the generation of hydrogen which makes it difficult to utilize in conventional internal combustion engines. In this study, an engine equipped with sub-chamber feature was used to overcome slow combustion rate of lean-burn condition of iso-octane/air mixture. Iso-octane was chosen as the fuel specifically since in lean-burn conditions, where the excess air ratio is near 1.8, its laminar burning velocity is similar to that of ammonia. The study was conducted using a single cylinder modified diesel engine which features spark plug and glow plug in a sub-chamber. The investigations varied the engine speeds (1000 and 1500 RPMs), glow plug voltages (6 V and 10 V), excess air ratios (1.4 to 1.8), and ignition timings (362 \u00b0CA to 365 \u00b0CA). The results suggested improved engine performances with a lower excess air ratio and higher glow plug voltage due to more complete and stable combustion. By increasing the engine speed, the lean burn limit was extended as seen from the improved engine performances. Because of the sub chamber feature, advancing the ignition timing, with respect to the after top dead centre, resulted in lower \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bko20fsAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2079660148804697053", "cites_id": ["2079660148804697053"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19450/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3TsKB-Nv3BwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 3, "2025": 1}}
