Our findings suggest that there is a negative relationship between female independent directors and corporate risk taking, indicating that female independent directors can effectively lower risks during this period. In addition, it is reported that the negative impact of female independent directors on firm risks is pronounced in the hospitality industry, as well as in regions with higher confirmed cases of COVID-19. Our results call for greater female independent directors\u2019 recruitment in the boardroom, yielding benefits of lowering firm risks during a crisis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "PpEocSIAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16081625.2023.2198552", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p04AXV4M7bEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Data were collected by distributing questionnaires to 180 small to medium-sized enterprises in Indonesia\u2019s fashion industry that have used e-commerce platforms to conduct their business activities. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) in SmartPLS 3.0 software. The study suggests that IT capabilities significantly influence organizational agility and competitive advantage. Therefore, the study can serve as a basis for the Indonesian government to promote digitalization and the use of e-commerce among micro, small, and medium enterprise owners in order to face changes in the market and remain competitive. It can also be beneficial for business owners and managers that aim to increase awareness of the importance of technology in their business operations. The work of this paper deepens the understanding of the relationship between IT capabilities, organizational agility, and competitive advantage, which are becoming increasingly important in the current digitalized and ever-changing business environment. It enriches the literature about micro, small and medium enterprise that is related to their IT capabilities level, how they use it to handle changes and factors that contributes in obtaining competitive advantage."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "PpEocSIAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8497272200261970135", "cites_id": ["8497272200261970135"], "pub_url": "https://ijbs.petra.ac.id/index.php/ijbs/article/view/171", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:16hqsAtg7HUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 6, "2024": 5, "2025": 5}}

Access to financial services is provided to all segments of the society. Currently, MSMEs are still experiencing difficulties in terms of capital. Access to financial services in banking is also still difficult due to the lack of financial information on the MSMEs when compared to large, more transparent companies; thus, banks have more difficulty in assessing the creditworthiness of MSMEs. This study examines the influence of financial technology (fintech), which is developing rapidly in Indonesia. The variables used in this study are financial inclusion, MSME performance, and the use of fintech e-payment as moderating variables. The results revealed that financial inclusion has a relationship with the performance of MSMEs. Financial inclusion encourages people to access financial products, and people can more freely use their money to make transactions. The fintech variable does not have a moderating effect on the relationship between financial inclusion and MSME performance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "PpEocSIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1392020753356263321", "cites_id": ["1392020753356263321"], "pub_url": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/51382/9781000473230.pdf?sequence=1#page=174", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mY_F-39zURMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2, "2024": 2, "2025": 1}}

We then use the selected group to estimate our outcomes of interest. We apply the synthetic regression method to examine the causal effects of the 2004 Asian tsunami on economic growth in Aceh, the Indonesian province severely hit by the tsunami. Our results show that the tsunami has an unintended effect on Aceh\u2019s economic growth performance.
