X customers comes from various regions in Indonesia, like Medan, Ambon, Bali, Fak-Fak, Sorong, Manokwari, Bintuni, and Wasior. The obstacle is the percentage of rework in 2020 reached 5.79%. At UD. X all defective saws will be reworked which will delay the production schedule and deliveries. Therefore, this study is to reduce the percentage of rework using DMAIC. Pareto diagram shows there are three main types of defects, namely wave defects, thickened results, and thin joints. Cause-and-effect diagram shows that the cause is in man, method, and machine factors. There were five proposals made, four of them were successfully implemented, namely the manufacture of DRB, daily production boards, SOP, and track record of maintenance machines. One proposal that postponed is the manufacture of a joint thickness checking plate due to time constraints. After implementation, there was a decrease in the percentage of rework by 1.22% from January-December 2020, bringing the percentage of rework in November 2021 to 4.57%. Control efforts made include the use of daily production boards, monthly evaluations, utilization of track record, DRB, and SOP."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DWHa6hQAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/12726", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gokO26_VrzMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Standaritation on every process needs to be done with a system that fits company needs. The standaritations trial could be done through a quality management system towards the production department. The document will be used to support the quality management in the future. The designing was done through observing and direct interview to operator and related admin. The observation\u2019s result will be supporting data in the designing of the quality management system in PT. X. The designed document is next to be evaluated and validated by the supervisor and head of production and cones. The validated document then will be stored as a written guidelines for the production process. The result is SOP, Work Instruction, Business Process, Quality Plan and Supporting Form. The documents will be given to related employees and become the documents that will be placed in several spots throughout the company as a retraining way to minimize the defect products."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DWHa6hQAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/12922", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1_9P3PqQuS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

The company tries to increase the effectiveness of the machine by implementing TPM. The case study on the service crane will be analysed/calculated using Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), which is one of the evaluation tools for TPM. OEE can show the productivity percentage of the crawler crane machine. The calculation of Six Big Losses also needs to be done to find out what losses have influenced the crawler crane effectiveness\u2019 the most.
