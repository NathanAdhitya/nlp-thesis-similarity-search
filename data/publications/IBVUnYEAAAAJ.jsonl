It examines the effectiveness of a product or country image, as well as the hedonistic and utilitarian message towards the brand attitude of a product. This study also includes the moderating effect of brand sustainability to observe the effect of a good or bad sustainability image on the brand attitude of a product. This study uses an experimental approach using a fictitious Swiss chocolate brand with either a hedonistic or utilitarian-focused message, followed by a display of a country or product image, as well as a sustainability report using the Chocolate Scorecard as a template. The participants are then given a set of four bipolar items before and after the sustainability report to rate the brand attitude of the product. The results show a non-significant relationship between hedonistic and utilitarian messages towards brand attitude, while it shows a significant relationship between country and product image towards brand attitude. The results also show that a sustainable label shows a similar positive impact towards brand attitude, while a non-sustainable label has a more adverse impact on product image compared to country image."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IBVUnYEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/20922/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y3mIvqFzYLkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Data were gathered from a final sample of 210 valid respondents through simple random sampling and subsequently analyzed using PLS-SEM. The results indicate that price value, green consumption value, and facilitating conditions significantly and positively contribute to the intention to adopt solar panels. Conversely, social influence plays an insignificant role in the decision-making process. These findings offer valuable insights that can inform policy initiatives and enhance marketing strategies for promoting renewable energy solutions in Indonesia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IBVUnYEAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3431439157149264698", "cites_id": ["3431439157149264698"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/20921/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Oms_nrvrni8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 1, "2025": 1}}

Information Technology has become crucial for businesses to enhance their ability to manage and adapt to change. This study examines East Java manufacturing companies that have heavily invested in sustainable IT systems to enhance their supply chain responsiveness and resilience through improved purchasing strategies and production flexibility. The study collected data from companies that had implemented IT for at least three years, with respondents being permanent employees with a minimum of two years' experience. Analysis of 108 survey responses using SmartPLS 4 revealed significant impacts of IT implementation on purchasing strategy (0.610), production flexibility (0.363), and supply chain responsiveness (0.164). Furthermore, purchasing strategy influenced production flexibility (0.367), supply chain responsiveness (0.348), and resilience (0.166). Production flexibility also affected supply chain responsiveness (0.348) and resilience (0.343), while responsiveness impacted resilience by 0.306. These findings provide a practical contribution for functional managers in companies regarding the importance of IT investment in developing effective purchasing, production, and marketing strategies to meet market demands swiftly. The research contributes to supply chain strategy and resilience theory while highlighting the significance of strong collaboration with external partners for top management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IBVUnYEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ro.ecu.edu.au/ecuworks2022-2026/4859/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DqUoOM6V0EIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

The analysis compares the relationship between variables at two levels: industry and brand, each at varying levels of maturity. Results indicate that at the industry level, brand image plays a positive mediating role in the relationship between celebrity endorsement and purchase intention, despite a negative direct relationship between the two. At the brand level, celebrity endorsement has a negative impact on purchase intention for Samsung, while exhibiting no significant effect on Vivo brand. However, brand image positively mediates the relationship between the two.

Four factors proposed in this study, namely ease of payment, trust, benefits of online shopping, and information quality, were hypothesized to affect millennial's purchasing decision. Data is gathered from millennials who have bought airline tickets online. The questionnaire is spread online, and data from 94 valid respondents is collected. To test the hypotheses, the data is analyzed with Multiple Linear Regression using SPSS. The adjusted r-square result is 0.483, which means that 48.3% of the variability of the dependent variable is explained by the four independent variables.
