Application testing is carried out using the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) method for the mobile version of the application. The implementation of the simple moving average method in predicting gold prices is also measured for accuracy by calculating the error on each price prediction data using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) method approach and the result is that the MAPE value is not more than 10%.
