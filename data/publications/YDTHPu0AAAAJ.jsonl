Sistem manual yang digunakan saat ini tidak mampu mengakomodasi kebutuhan khusus karyawan difabel,  terutama  tunarungu,  yang  menghadapi  kesulitan  dalam  menjalankan  tugas  administratif  secara efektif. Sebagai solusi, dirancang sistem digitalisasi berbasis teknologi yang dirancang secara inklusif untuk mendukung karyawan difabel. Sistem ini menawarkan antarmuka yang lebih visual dengan  penggunaan  ikon  gambar  dan  warna,  sehingga  memudahkan  karyawan  tunarungu  dalam  mengoperasikan  sistem  tanpa  terlalu  bergantung  pada  teks.

This study employed purposive sampling to select publicly traded companies from the LQ45 index list spanning the years 2018 to 2022. The data was examined by panel data modelling with the Weighted Least Square technique. The evaluation of good corporate governance is conducted through the utilisation of a score derived from the corporate governance perception index, whereas the assessment of business value is accomplished by employing the Tobin's Q ratio. The moderating variable of environmental costs is assessed by considering the costs associated with Corporate Social Responsibility programs. The results indicated that good corporate governance exerts a negative influence on the value of firms during covid-19 conditions. The present study did not achieve success in establishing the moderating effect of environmental costs on the association between good corporate governance and firm value. The present study provides several implications for corporate governance practitioners in managing companies during crisis and also investors in formulating future investment decisions.

Capital expenditure is represented by the growth of fixed assets for the current period.

The companies sampled should fulfill the criteria of having complete financial data for the six years before the sampling period. The hypothesis testing proves that capital expenditure impacts long-term performance, with no evidence to the contrary. Additional testing utilizing the control variables generated additional interesting results with important implications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YDTHPu0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16079548107018164411", "cites_id": ["16079548107018164411"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19822/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u1ifa88HJt8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 5}}

This study examines the effect of the issue on market response and future financial performance. The sample includes large-cap companies listed on the Indonesia Stock  Exchange (IDX) for 2016\u20132021. Samples must have at least 120 active trading days for each year. Two hundred and thirty-two observations meet the qualifications. This study adopts the investment inefficiency model developed by previous studies to measure over-investment or under-investment. Residual inefficient investment models are used as over-investment or under-investment scores, in addition to the dummy of the residual category.  Market response is measured by cumulative abnormal returns (CAR), market capitalization (MCAP), and market-to-book value (MTB). Meanwhile, a firm\u2019s performance uses return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE).  The results show that the coefficient of the inefficient investment variable, using both the  residual value and the dummy variable, shows a negative direction, which means the market responds negatively to over-investment or under-investment. However, the value of t is significant at the <0.01 level on the market response variable as measured by MTB, but not significant for the other two proxies. Thus, hypothesis 1 is supported, although not for all market response proxies. The value of the inefficient investment coefficient also shows a negative direction when testing hypothesis 2 and is significant at the <0.1 level. These results are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YDTHPu0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14277329757727483001", "cites_id": ["14277329757727483001"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19765/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eeR1JsVDI8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2024": 1, "2025": 1}}

This study measures different perceptions of accounting students based on gender (male and female), year of study (junior and senior), and the type of university (public and private). The majority of accounting students agree with the importance of accountants\u2019 role in IT sustainability practices by utilizing information systems. However, differences in perceptions of accountants\u2019 IT responsibility, accountants\u2019 IT competence, and the importance of IT sustainability practice are found in the senior and junior student groups. This finding results in junior students being higher than senior students in understanding the importance of the accountants\u2019 role in the IT sustainability practice. Differences were also found in the groups of students from public and private universities, where students in public universities have a higher perception than students in private universities toward IT sustainability issues. There is no difference in perception in the gender group. This study can be helpful for higher education providers and teachers in accounting who play an essential role in supporting students to understand the practical implementation in accounting professions regarding their role in sustainability through the utilization of information technology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YDTHPu0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ijbs.petra.ac.id/index.php/ijbs/article/view/183", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FaOJzCCNlS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
