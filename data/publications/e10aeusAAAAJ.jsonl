Kegiatan pengabdian ini mengembangkan cara pembelajaran ke tingkat yang lebih aplikatif dibanding semester sebelumnya. Dalam kegiatan ini anak-anak dan remaja di panti asuhan Sola Gratia diajarkan resep dan menghasilkan minuman yang bernilai jual, sekaligus memasarkannya di lingkungan sekitar panti asuhan. Tahapan kegiatan diawali ceramah pembekalan perhitungan harga pokok produksi, praktik produksi produk dan minuman, proses pemasaran produk, perhitungan keuntungan, dan evaluasi. Produk yang dihasilkan berupa minuman siap konsumsi, makanan berupa kue kering yang telah di-repacking, gelang dari manik-manik.

The implication for managers is to incorporate ESG activities as they positively impact the market reaction, particularly activities related to Environmental issues.
