This study employed purposive sampling to select publicly traded companies from the LQ45 index list spanning the years 2018 to 2022. The data was examined by panel data modelling with the Weighted Least Square technique. The evaluation of good corporate governance is conducted through the utilisation of a score derived from the corporate governance perception index, whereas the assessment of business value is accomplished by employing the Tobin's Q ratio. The moderating variable of environmental costs is assessed by considering the costs associated with Corporate Social Responsibility programs. The results indicated that good corporate governance exerts a negative influence on the value of firms during covid-19 conditions. The present study did not achieve success in establishing the moderating effect of environmental costs on the association between good corporate governance and firm value. The present study provides several implications for corporate governance practitioners in managing companies during crisis and also investors in formulating future investment decisions.

The studys major finding is that profitability and liquidity have no direct impact on firm value, but financial distress does. Signal theory states that information about financial circumstances that are not in financial distress might encourage investors to invest, hence increasing Firm Value. This research contributes to the literature on the impact of Financial Distress in predicting the influence of Profitability and Liquidity on boosting Firm Value."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gc4hXy4AAAAJ:0ngZmJvimKcC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2090368739120471004", "cites_id": ["2090368739120471004"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19485/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3FvbAEt7Ah0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 9, "2024": 2, "2025": 4}}

In its development, there are many conditions that can affect this relationship. One of the conditions that are expected to be involved is the condition of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic has a significant role in the economic downturn, which in turn could affect the companys profit target. Profits that do not reach the target may lead the CEOs to do earnings management. This study is aimed to determine the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the relationship between CEO compensation and earnings management. Earnings management is measured using discretionary accrual proxy with Modified Jones Model. The study was conducted on 217 non-financial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2019-2020. Technical analysis of the data uses panel data regression with the GRETL program. The results showed that the greater the compensation received by the CEO, the lower the level of earnings management. Not to mention, the results of this study indicate that the Covid-19 pandemic conditions weaken the negative relationship between CEO compensation and earnings management. In other words, the negative relationship between CEO compensation and earnings management is stronger in conditions before the pandemic than during the pandemic. The results of this study are expected to help shareholders in deciding the provision of compensation to the CEO in the midst of a pandemic situation"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gc4hXy4AAAAJ:MDX3w3dAD3YC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=866207255930758773", "cites_id": ["866207255930758773"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19471/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dWae7-hiBQwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}

Although it has been done a lot, previous studies have not considered the educational condition of the Chief Financial Officer. The level of education of the Chief Financial Officer is a phenomenon that is thought to affect the real earnings management practice of an organization. The Chief Financial Officer has the responsibility of preparing and overseeing the preparation of the companys financial statements. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the level of education of the Chief Financial Officer can affect the relationship of Good Corporate Governance to real earnings management. The phenomenon of GCG referred to in this study includes the age and size (number) of the audit committee. The audit committee also has a duty to ensure the reliability of financial statements. The research was conducted on 70 companies in the property, real estate, healthcare, and technology industry sectors that were listed on the IDX in 2018-2019. Data were analyzed using panel data regression analysis using Gretl software. The results of the study prove that the older the average age of the audit committee will potentially reduce the practice of real earnings management and the greater the number of audit committees will potentially increase the practice of real earnings management. In addition, in companies with a high level of Chief Financial Officer education, the relationship between audit committee size and real earnings management is weaker than companies with a lower Chief Financial Officer education level.
