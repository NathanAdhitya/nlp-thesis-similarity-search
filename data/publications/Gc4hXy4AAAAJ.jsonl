Good corporate governance is formed in companies by increasing the role of supervise independent commission. This research aims to analyze the influence of good corporate governance on financial performance by using the whistleblowing system as a moderating variable. This research uses research samples from companies included in the LQ45. The research results state that good corporate governance with independent commissions positively affects financial performance. This condition can be seen from the increasing role and function of supervisors not affiliated with the company. Second, good corporate governance with an independent commission supported by the whistleblowing system can  strengthen  the  impact  of  good  corporate  governance  on  financial  performance.  Third,  the  whistleblowing  system  established  in companies has not been able to play a direct role  in improving financial performance because there is still no system established in companies, and there are no government regulations to protect employees who disclose violations. Research provides practical contributions for  governments  and  company  managers  to  form  adequate  independent  commissions  because  it  can  produce  increased  financial performance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gc4hXy4AAAAJ:X5YyAB84Iw4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/21321/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZI38pMccWEgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

This study employed purposive sampling to select publicly traded companies from the LQ45 index list spanning the years 2018 to 2022. The data was examined by panel data modelling with the Weighted Least Square technique. The evaluation of good corporate governance is conducted through the utilisation of a score derived from the corporate governance perception index, whereas the assessment of business value is accomplished by employing the Tobin's Q ratio. The moderating variable of environmental costs is assessed by considering the costs associated with Corporate Social Responsibility programs. The results indicated that good corporate governance exerts a negative influence on the value of firms during covid-19 conditions. The present study did not achieve success in establishing the moderating effect of environmental costs on the association between good corporate governance and firm value. The present study provides several implications for corporate governance practitioners in managing companies during crisis and also investors in formulating future investment decisions.
