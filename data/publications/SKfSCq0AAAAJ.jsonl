The study focuses on the significance of \"tirtha,\" or water, in the artworks showcased by artists from various academic institutions. The research method employed curatorial practices that interconnect the meaning of water with issues of ecosystem sustainability, spirituality, and human life. The study reveals that the messages conveyed through visual art are not merely denotative but also hold philosophical meanings closely tied to culture and spirituality. Water is portrayed as a source of life, energy, emotion, and purity. The research demonstrates that artists create their works as a form of visual communication, reminding viewers of the contextual importance of water. In methodology, art curation is considered a communicative activity involving the exploration of meanings, and using curative methods requires relevance to complex themes and contexts. This study contributes to the understanding of communication processes and meanings in visual art, particularly within the contexts of Communication Science and Visual Communication Design studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SKfSCq0AAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://proceeding-mediacon.petra.ac.id/index.php/med/article/view/7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:273cR2ZhnWMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Developments in the field of  media have led to the existence of new mediums in communication. New mediums through mass  media channels have given the public many options, including politicians, to share. This study  examined how the language used by politicians and communication strategies through selected  mediums influence society in the face of elections. This study focused on the messages conveyed  through social media, namely Twitter. The study used a content analysis method that examined as  many as six Twitter accounts of influential politicians in the community in Indonesia. The review period  for selected Twitter accounts is from 10 September 2022 until 20 November 2022. The findings found  that most Twitter account owners chose social and economic issues to write on Twitter accounts  rather than political issues. This differs from the previous study s results; most researchers stated that  most politicians prioritize politics-related issues. This difference may be due to differences in terms of  cultural, economic background, and political trends. While the language used is more of a common  language, i.e., informal, than formal or provocative. The choice of language, neither formal nor  Layman language, makes what is presented accessible for the community to understand from  different backgrounds. This means that politicians are making social media a medium for dealing with  issues related to political matters"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SKfSCq0AAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14752612181327380102", "cites_id": ["14752612181327380102"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/20971/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hn4ewZ3Ou8wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2025": 2}}
