The rapid initial setting time required was also different for the concrete for typical construction. Our previous mixture composition incorporating calcium oxide to accelerate the initial setting time was adequate. However, the extrusion process was still not satisfactory. In this study, the effect of cement to sand ratio, sand particle size, and the addition of synthetic micro-fiber was investigated on the main properties of 3D printing materials, ie, initial setting time, flowability, extrudability, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "QiMYEOoAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1993697832498592343", "cites_id": ["1993697832498592343"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/907/1/012011/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V3qLl50JqxsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 4, "2024": 0, "2025": 1}}

In this method, selected columns are designed to remain elastic and the plastic hinges are allowed to occur only at the columns base. These columns are designed to resist increased forces.

A new approach to predict the required strengths needed  to design each structural member, called modified-PCD (M-PCD) is proposed. In this research six and ten-story reinforced concrete buildings were designed using M-PCD, and their seismic  performances are investigated.

In addition, possible application of friction-based support is also studied. Full 3D non-linear time history analysis is conducted to observe behavior of the structure under two-directional ground motion. In the analysis, any failed elements are removed subsequently from the model to avoid numerical analysis problem. The result shows that the placement of masonry infill walls can significantly influence the structural behavior of RC structure.

The initial setting time of the concrete also needs to be controlled as it needs to adhere to the next layer and then harden rapidly in order to support the upper layer. This study proposes a method to control the initial setting time of the concrete for the 3D printing process by using a mixture of calcium oxide powder and accelerators.
