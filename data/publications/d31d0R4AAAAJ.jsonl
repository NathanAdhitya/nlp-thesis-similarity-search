Pelatihan pembuatan dashboard Excel ini bertujuan membantu pengurus gereja memanfaatkan data untuk diolah, dianalisis, dan digali informasinya agar dapat melahirkan ide-ide program kerja yang berguna dan tepat bagi jemaat. Adapun mitra pengabdian masyarakat adalah Majelis Gereja Kristen Indonesia (GKI) Kutisari Indah Surabaya beserta para aktivis gereja dari berbagai komisi pelayanan. Hasil dari pelatihan ini adalah para peserta dapat membuat dashboard; dan capaiannya adalah program kerja tiap komisi telah memanfaatkan informasi yang disajikan dalam bentuk dashboard untuk meningkatkan pelayanan bagi para pengunjung gereja. Sebagai simpulan, dashboard Excel data administrasi gerejawi dapat menyajikan informasi yang membantu pengurus gereja dalam mengatur strategi, merancang program kerja, mengeval__uasi, dan mengambil keputusan dengan lebih baik dan tepat sasaran. Rekomendasi tindak lanjutnya adalah pelatihan penajaman kemampuan analisis pengurus gereja supaya hasil dari dashboard menjadi dasar penentuan yang strategis untuk pengembangan gereja ke depannya."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "d31d0R4AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ebook.umpwr.ac.id/abdimas/article/view/5612", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o7Kt_sRcBDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Capturing the social value of a building in a sales or rental price is very important but challenging because its definition could be interpreted widely due to the subjectivity and nature of social value for each case building, which produces ambiguity for the different auditors and the stakeholders. To give a reasonable estimate for the value (either for sales and/or rental price), we propose and illustrate how to use ordinal (and nominal) rating data to capture social value together with other common building characteristics. We propose a novel, simple, and practical approach using Gower Distance, i.e., Gower (Dis)similarity index(es) among comparable buildings & clustering technique as the basis. Hence, it is more flexible in selecting comparable buildings & can be easily adapted to measure Social Value. Together with the classic grid adjustment method (Quality Point/Quality Rating adjustment), they can be used to provide a fair market estimate for the rental (or sale) price of buildings capturing the social value.

It can be concluded that the government\u2019s strategy of collaborating the two policies is effective to overcome the pandemic in Surabaya. Nevertheless, the implementation of policies to overcome this pandemic success with contributions from all elements of society."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "d31d0R4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/19095/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8bjY90Tq-joJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

This research aims to evaluate the Surabaya Government policy scenario using a dynamic system-based simulation with Vensim Ventana software. The initial model was designed with adopting the Covid-19 model made by Tom Fiddaman, Ventana System in 2020 adjusted to real conditions in Surabaya. The simulation results obtained from the initial validated model estimate that the Covid-19 pandemic would end on May 5, 2021, with total infected 15,876 people. The model was then developed by simulating several policy scenarios: herd immunity, convalescent plasma therapy, and swab test to predict \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "d31d0R4AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1977825865265473079", "cites_id": ["1977825865265473079"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9431889/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N2a6PiWmchsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}

The curriculum that evaluated in this final project are the curriculum in 2007, 2012, and 2016 with student data used are class 2007, 2012 and 2016. Curriculum evaluation is analyzed using the efficiency measurement method. In addition to efficiency calculations and analysis, this study also looks for the influence between curriculum and majors on GPA by using One-Way ANOVA, Kruskall Wallis, Paired T-Test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. The results obtained indicate that the curriculum changes made by Industrial Engineering are more efficient. Curriculum efficiency has a significant effect on the final GPA and the length of time students graduate. In addition, there is an increase in the final GPA of students compared to the GPA until semester 5, before determining the majors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "d31d0R4AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/13042", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YE5BtDUyf-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

But in practice, some problems occurred in the system. Office crews need a long time to process the data and there is not enough information to make a decision. However, the problem can be solved by designing a ship performance dashboard. The dashboard objective is to visualize the important data from the ship so that the company can access the needed information. The dashboard design is based on reports that are sent by the ship crew and then processed with software. Processing data with software can make it easier and faster for the company. The processed data will be visualized using a dashboard for different purposes based on the information that\u2019s needed. Overall, dashboard visualization will provide information about ship audit progress, machine damage and repairment that occurred, main engine indicator, and warning system for each main engine and generator component running hours."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "d31d0R4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publication.petra.ac.id/index.php/teknik-industri/article/view/12696", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sDjPkjCE_wsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
