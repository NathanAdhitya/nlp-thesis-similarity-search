The study used panel regression analysis. The research found that corporate governance through interlock directorates is a determinant of high-tech firm performance. The low human capital with high-tech capabilities in ASEAN countries can be overcome by interlocking and facilitating companies to access strategic information. This study also found a positive association between director woman interlock and corporate performance. On the other hand, an independent director who does interlocking actually has a negative effect on company performance.

The research sample was 70 banks in ASEAN from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam in the 2015-2018 period in which the annual reports used dual language or English. The study used regression panel analysis. Digital innovation and risk disclosure used content analysis. Indicators of digital innovation used digital branches and mobile banking. The results of the study found that the higher the digital innovation, the greater the bank profitability. However, only mobile banking has a significant effect. The next finding is the disclosure of potential risks in the annual report gave a negative signal to ASEAN banking, resulting in lower bank profitability. The uniqueness of the ASEAN setting is dominated by a very large, dynamic, and rapidly adapting population of productive age to digital technology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "nUgsEucAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6686886679225973343", "cites_id": ["6686886679225973343"], "pub_url": "https://ejournal.undiksha.ac.id/index.php/JIA/article/view/33321", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XzqOkAGYzFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1, "2024": 1, "2025": 1}}
