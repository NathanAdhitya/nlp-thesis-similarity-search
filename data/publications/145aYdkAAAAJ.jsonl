Here we describe the identification of 7\u03b1,25-dihydroxycholesterol (also called 7\u03b1,25-OHC or 5-cholesten-3\u03b2,7\u03b1,25-triol) as a potent and selective agonist of EBI2. Functional activation of human EBI2 by 7\u03b1,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols was verified by monitoring second messenger readouts and saturable, high-affinity radioligand binding. Furthermore, we find that 7\u03b1,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols act as chemoattractants for immune cells expressing EBI2 by directing cell migration in vitro and in vivo. A critical enzyme required for the generation of 7\u03b1,25-OHC is cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H).
