In its early form, it was used extensively in the quantitative analysis of newspapers, and its applications later evolved to include electronic media such as radio and television. It has recently been applied to digital media, including the Internet. However, the use of content analysis in analyzing online content has been chiefly applied to static content, such as \u2018static\u2019websites, in the early days of the Internet. Studies that involve its use in analyzing dynamic Internet content\u2014for example, content that resides behind databases\u2014are relatively much less common. This article is not written as a research paper per se. This article will instead discuss reflections on the efficacy of content analysis as a research method when applied to dynamic content such as DRs by using a previous study, which has applied content analysis to the dynamic content of digital repositories (DRs), as a case study. The previous study used as the basis for this article had applied content analysis to several DRs using manual counting by the researcher. In the process, several idiosyncrasies in terms of the way institutions populate their DRs with digital objects and the user metadata to facilitate discoverability of those digital objects were encountered that have introduced some \u2018complication.\u2019This article will focus on how content analysis, as a research method, can be adapted to account for those idiosyncrasies to produce better results. This article will also identify the limitations and challenges of content analysis in dynamic online environments and offer some suggested approaches."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Qrh3IkAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10737284109844123931", "cites_id": ["10737284109844123931"], "pub_url": "https://jurnalindustri.petra.ac.id/index.php/ind/article/view/25121", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G5G0YwJ_ApUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1, "2024": 6, "2025": 1}}

METHODS Content analysis was conducted of 52 Indonesian higher education institutional repository websites between November 2014 and February 2015. Assessment included the degrees of \u201copenness\u201d of repositories, the types of works collected, software used, exploration tools, existence of links to institutional website, the language used for access points, and the standard of metadata. The study also gathered qualitative indicators of local practices in the management and population of repositories. RESULTS Only 26.9% of the surveyed IRs provide all or most documents in full-text; the most widely included types of work are Theses and Dissertations (84.6%) and Published Works (80.8%), but there is also a high representation of Unpublished Works and University Records. Most IRs (90.3%) provide access points in the form of standardized subject headings, and English is widely used. DISCUSSION The characteristics of the content of the IRs surveyed suggests that many Indonesian IRs were conceived as a corporate information management system rather than as a genuine attempt to support open access. CONCLUSION The findings lead the authors to speculate that institutional repositories serving Indonesian higher education institutions are in their early adoption phase; and that initial drivers for them have been corporate information management, institutional prestige, and the need to combat plagiarism."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Qrh3IkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1606492570548411405", "cites_id": ["1606492570548411405"], "pub_url": "https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/jlsc/article/id/12777/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DZzXOXtoSxYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 2, "2024": 4}}
