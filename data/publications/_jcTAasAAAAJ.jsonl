However, the effectiveness of daylighting in interior spaces can be influenced by several factors, including the window-to-wall ratio (WWR), glass visible transmittance (VT), and the reflectance of walls, ceilings, and floors. This study investigates how these factors affect indoor average illuminance. To model the indoor lighting environment and adjust these factors, a simulation method using DIALux software was employed. Multiple linear regression analysis was then used to assess the impact of each factor on average illuminance. The results reveal that WWR and VT are the most significant variables, with their increases leading to substantial improvements in illuminance, though the benefits diminish at higher levels. In contrast, ceiling and floor reflectance have minimal effects, with ceiling reflectance being the least impactful. The regression analysis validates the model's high predictive accuracy and highlights the critical role of WWR and VT in achieving optimal lighting conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "_jcTAasAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ojs.unimal.ac.id/index.php/arsitekno/article/view/18544", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_aBdGW4UpMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}

Previous research has shown that while cafe lighting frequently falls short of SNI standards, this does not impede the spaces functionality, and the effects of these deficiencies on customer experiences remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the light intensity and customer comfort at Threelogy Coffee and Zybrick Coffee and Cantina, two caf s characterized by markedly different designs and lighting conditions. Field surveys and light intensity measurements using lux meter were conducted to evaluate the lighting conditions at both locations, while questionnaires were used to assess visitor perceptions of comfort. At Threelogy Coffee, light intensity levels are notably high, with indoor measurements ranging from 360 to 465 lux and reaching up to 34,705 lux in semi-outdoor areas. Conversely, Zybrick Coffee and Cantina exhibits lower light intensity, with indoor levels between 65 and 70 lux and semi-outdoor areas ranging from 240 to 670 lux. Survey results reveal that customers to Threelogy Coffee generally express satisfaction with the bright lighting, although there is a potential risk of long-term monotony. Meanwhile, customers to Zybrick Coffee and Cantina report comfort despite the dim lighting, which is attributed to the private and intimate atmosphere fostered by the caf s design. Both caf s exhibit comparable levels of overall comfort, highlighting the significance of atmospheric design elements, in addition to lighting, in creating a positive customer experience.

An office building was modeled with various window-to-wall ratio (WWR) using panasap glass with SC=0.58 in order to analyze the effect of the WWR addition on cooling energy usage and comfort temperature. The result suggested that the average increase of the cooling energy usage is about 5.67% per 10% WWR addition, and of the operative temperature ranges from 0.350C to 0.560C per 10% WWR addition. Moreover, the building with above 20% WWR doesn\u2019t provide comfort temperature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "_jcTAasAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12579880497018979587", "cites_id": ["12579880497018979587"], "pub_url": "https://repository.petra.ac.id/17935/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A0WuNam2lK4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2, "2024": 2, "2025": 1}}
