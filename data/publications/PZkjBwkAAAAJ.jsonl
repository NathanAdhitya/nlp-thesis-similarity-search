The current study investigates the effects of ammonia as the carbon-free fuel in the LPG using an external premixed combustor under stoichiometric fuel mixtures. Volumetric ratios of 0%-50% between LPG and NH3 were investigated to understand the effect of replacing LPG with NH3 on flame characteristics.

The thermo-mechanical properties of the material for better disc brake components have been investigated. Some geometrics of the disc brake design models have also been studied to determine the heat distribution that occurs during braking. However, brake failure cases still occur frequently. Most of the brake failures are preceded by the occurrence of overheating when the vehicle is braked continuously on a declining road. This indicates that the heat dissipation system during braking does not work well. This study focuses on designing an unconventional brake system, that uses an active cooling system. Under conditions of large braking loads, the brake system will actively cool down by spraying water on the caliper so the brakes will not experience overheating. The design of this system consists of temperature sensors mounted on the caliper, an over-temperature control unit and also a cooling unit. The design is implemented on a four-wheel vehicle brake model. The increase of caliper temperature at the time of braking is simulated by putting the temperature sensor on the Bunsen burner.

The need for glazing windows in that area sometimes cannot be avoided due to various reasons regarding to space planning inside the building. The presence of east-west glazing windows causes the increasing of air conditioning load of the building at a significant rate, which causes increasing energy usage. There are several external shading devices available to be used to limit the incoming low-altitude angle sunlight falling to that direction, however all the available sun shading devices are not adjusted and based on the fixed location as a part of building fa\u00e7ade. Since the sun moves regularly according to its daily and seasonal path, generally the fixed external sun shading does not function well to reduce solar heat gain as well as to keep an indoor standard illumination level \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "PZkjBwkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15055643556457558216", "cites_id": ["15055643556457558216"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281501784X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yDCN3wtk8NAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2, "2024": 5}}

EMA diaplikasikan di berbagai bidang, antara lain rekayasa struktur, otomotif, disain, maupun pemesinan. Dalam EMA pengukuran gaya input (excitation force) dan respon dari struktur (frequency response function, FRF) dilakukan dalam domain waktu (time domain) yang kemudian diubah dalam domain frekuensi (frequency domain) menggunakan Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Penelitian ini menyajikan aplikasi EMA untuk mengukur karakteristik dinamik balok kayu yang dapat digunakan sebagai penguat (stiffener) struktur berongga berbentuk kotak, ataupun rangka kapal kayu. Informasi tentang karakteristik dinamik balok kayu sangat terbatas, sehingga EMA dilakukan untuk mengetahui modal parameter kayu sebelum digunakan sebagai penguat. Eksperimen dilakukan menggunakan modal hammer untuk memberikan gaya input pada balok kayu dan akselerometer (accelerometer) untuk mengukur responnya dalam bentuk percepatan. Hasil yang diperoleh digunakan untuk mengetahui modal parameter struktur berupa frekuensi pribadi (natural frequency), bentuk modus getar (mode shape) dan rasio redaman. Balok kayu memiliki dimensi panjang 860 mm, berpenampang bujur sangkar dengan panjang sisi 50 mm. Untuk melengkapi kajian eksperimen, juga dilakukan simulasi modal analysis terhadap balok kayu menggunakan metode elemen hingga (finite element analysis). Dari empat titik yang diuji, masing-masing menghasilkan kurva fungsi transfer, kurva amplitude dan kurva sudut fasa.
